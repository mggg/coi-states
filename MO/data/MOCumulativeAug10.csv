Many of the apt. buildings on Armour Blvd were 100% Section 8 until Mac Properties started turning them into market rate apartments probably less than 10 years ago, and only two 100% Section 8 buildings remain.  Mac is building 3 new apt. buildings on Armour (also market rate), and there is already not enough off-street parking.  Although a nursing home and a group home for people with developmental disabilities have been returned to large single family homes in the last several years, there are still houses and buildings that serve as transitional housing for people in substance abuse recovery, families experiencing homelessness, and people with mental health concerns.  There are 3 liberal mainline Protestant Churches, two of which provide office space for worker's rights nonprofit organizations, and all three provide services to low income people in the community and also welcome people who identify as LGBT.  Al-Inshirah Islamic Center is in this community.  Kansas City Public Schools are improving, but that's not well known, and charter and private schools still draw students away from KCPS.  Academie Lafayette French Immersion Charter School and Notre Dame de Sion Lower School are in the community.  The Nelson Atkins Museum of Art is in the generally affluent Rockhill neighborhood.  Houses in North and South Hyde Park and Southmoreland seem to be increasingly owner-occupied and more families with young children seem to be living in the neighborhoods.  Although housing prices are going up, homes in the area are still significantly less expensive than parts of Kansas City to the southwest.  60% of housing is renter-occupied.   2% of resdients have identified as Asian, 3% as more than one race, 8% as Hispanic, 30% as black, and 57% as white. Median income is  about $50,000.  Residents generally support expanding access to health care and the rights of workers, women, people with disabilities, and members of ethnic and racial minority groups.  LGBT homeowners and immigrants have been welcome in the community for decades. The community is located on the historically white side of the (artificially created) dividing line between black and white Kansas City--Troost Avenue, but the divide is being broken down.  ","This community has mostly older houses (100+ years). ""Urban pioneers"" moved to Central Hyde Park (Armour to 39th) in the '70s and rehabbed houses, returning houses that had been divided into apartments after WWII back into single family homes.  The neighborhood association became hyper vigilant about ""density,"" but there have always been apartments and duplexes throughout Hyde Park, mostly in North and South Hyde Park. In the last decade or so more houses in N and S Hyde Park seem to have become owner-occupied, and more have small children.  Historically, real estate agents steered home buyers away, citing Public School challenges and bias against ""Midtown,"" code for black and lower income people in the neighborhoods or nearby.  Housing prices are increasing.  Armour Blvd had many 100% Section 8 apartment buildings in the '80s, now all but 2 are market rate, as Mac Properties has invested heavily. A new large apartment building is about to open on Armour Blvd. and three more apartment buildings are being built on Armour Blvd and Troost. All of these are market rate rentals, and there's already a parking shortage for existing Armour Blvd. apartment dwellers).  Crime at Armour and Troost, and west to Gillham, has been problematic but seems to be improving in recent years. The neighborhoods have been welcoming to LGBT people for decades and homeowning neighbors have taken pride in being a diverse community that welcomes people of color and immigrants. Residents are generally politically liberal, in terms of supporting health care and the rights of workers, women, racial minorities.  Rockhill north of 47th was put in this community due to census tracts;  it's a generally affluent neighborhood in which the Nelson Atkins Museum of Art is located.  Part of Southmoreland is also in this community;  also old homes, many rehabbed in recent years. ",Hyde Park and parts of Rockhill and Southmoreland North of 47th and east of Oak,1,Jackson

This growth is due to excellent public schools and rapid housing development  In the 1990s Nixa school district was fastest growing school district in Missouri. Today, growth has slowed a bit--but not much. City government has been future oriented: Nixa Public Building Corporation was established about 1990 to issue bonds for a much-needed new City Hall; a fee was created whereby landlords pay for a city inspection each time the tenant changes making sure the rental is safe and meets building codes; Nixa City Council imposed a facial mask requirement during Covid that withstood some public opposition. County government has a history of cooperation with Nixa, one of the two largest cities in the county, especially in the area of economic development.

Thus far, the people that are buying these very expensive houses are not becoming part of the neighborhood as they don't have to interact when they are coming or going. The affordable housing is being replaced and the people are pushed out. The county is not helping as they increased real estate taxes far beyond the 15% allowable by state law.

This makes it a little difficult for shared identity to be well assessed. Shared interest and concerns are much easier. This side of town has a lot of concerns about poor infrastructure, especially in regards to sewers as well as under investment in our schools. Many if not all residents also feel that healthcare is inadequate despite the hospital being located here. As many residents do not have health insurance or cannot afford to use the insurance they do have, access is an issue. A further issue is the quality of care at our hospital, many folks who are able, get their medical care, especially specialist care, in Columbia or Jefferson City. Rural areas within these two census blocks have internet quality and access issues which affects many of the residents in town by proxy. It is not unusual for residents with internet access to allow their rural friends access to their passwords so that they can come download shows, do computer updates, or submit homework.  Many residents are employed in the service sector, education around town or in nearby towns and those in industrial warehouse or manufacturing jobs in the southwest part of town. Most of the higher income housing is out by the country club and over by Teal Lake. The Teal Lake area is a hodgepodge like the rest of the town.

A community concern is that recent and planned development is designed to attract higher income people. New homes that are being built to replace modest ones are very large costing $600k+. This is happening throughout Webster including North Webster, a historic, predominately Black neighborhood, pushing home prices up and working people out. New business development, of which there is quite a bit, is also aimed at high income people. This is making my community of over 20 years, unaffordable for regular working families who have made Webster Groves their home for decades.

My youngest is 13. It doesn't appear that many of us are home very often. We all seem to have more than one job. One of my biggest complaints is the waste management here. We definitely need roll carts. Every trash pick up, there's garbage in the streets and in people's yards because animals get into the bags or whatever. There's a few places you can walk to. There's two liquor stores, a mile apart from each other, in either direction. We also have a new gas station, car wash and one of the said liquor stores. They are rapidly building more apartments in that area, as well. I see people walking in the mornings and evenings. I tend to be out in the mornings, with other dog walkers. We had a garden last year but have been way to busy for that this year. However, the farmer's market is not too far but you've gotta drive there from our neighborhood. The city took out the bus stop in our area, which is unfortunate, especially now that there are more places to go in that neighborhood. It feels like a basic, normal, middleclass neighborhood. We don't go to church and I don't think our neighbors do either. We try to be on rivers and lakes anytime we have a free weekend. We used to grill outside and have friends and family over. We noticed the neighbors doing the same. COVID definitely changed that. We are all vaccinated but we still use caution.  I work in Fulton and have about a 45 minute commute. I think most of the people around me live and work in Columbia. We were pretty close with the neighbors that lived on the other side of our duplex but they just moved and bought a house. It's not a new development. I believe it was probably built sometime in the 80's and has had some renovations. We are renters. I wish we had a fenced in back yard but that's not going to happen until we buy our own home. It kind of feels like everyone living in these duplexes, looks at our housing as temporary, until we find what we want. They're pretty basic but functional. One thing that does bring us all together is our hatred of the trash system. ",Scott Blvd Neighborhood,1,Columbia

They can't make enough to be able to get the deposit and the first month's rent to move into a place. So they're forced to live in a tent. The other people who live there are not employed which means the employed people are also in jeopardy of getting robbed or killed over having a little money. I saw someone walk into a Walgreens and pull out a gun and say ""Give me $20, I need to feed my family."" So people need help so they don't feel like they have to commit crime to survive. The extended stay hotels have people stay there for free in exchange for doing work around the place, but then, especially if it's someone with an addiction, there is a risk to other people there of getting robbed to feed someone's drug habit.

St. Joseph is a community with people who like to stick to themselves and who often have political views that can be incongruent with aspects of their lived experience. They say they don't want government intervention (anti-welfare sentiments) but they also will rely on government assistance when it comes to them. This ""leave me alone attitude, me and my family will be fine on our own"" contributes to the high COVID cases and low vaccine rates that are endangering this community. 

The area has changed a lot in the time I've lived here. We once had strong union representation with 4 union packing houses. Most often the city relied on union construction contracts. Then, when the packing houses began to close, the wealth in the community declined and more contracts started to go to non-union contractors. This economic dive to the bottom coincided with the ideological changes in the community. 

St. Joseph was once a confederate stronghold and, though we are long past the Civil War era, racism continues to be passed down from generation to generation and it prevents this area from thriving in the ways that it could. ",Easton/St. Joseph,1,Easton

Things in my community haven't changed much over the close to 60 years I've lived here and yet have. The area between Troost and Hwy 435 is historically where Black people in Kansas City were confined to due to segregationist housing policies. Still today, Kansas City is racially divided and the East Side is the largest and most central Black community in the city. However, when Black people were allowed to move south of 27th street, our community experienced a dispersement as Black people were lured into the suburbs (and away from themselves) by promises of better schools and safer communities. 

This area has a long legacy of community leaders and we need the city, county, and state governments to start listening to us. Back when I worked for the city planning department, there was an initiative for neighborhoods to make their own neighborhood plans and submit those to the city. While white, affluent communities got what they asked for, Black and poor communities were brushed off. As a result, neighborhoods on the East Side have largely had to get what we need and want for ourselves (And we have! Drive down 51st St and you'll find speed bumps that the community organized to put in after 20 years of asking the city). ",Kansas City--Black Community ,1,Kansas City
