Historically, real estate agents steered home buyers away, citing Public School challenges and bias against \"Midtown,\" code for black and lower income people in the neighborhoods or nearby.

Crime at Armour and Troost, and west to Gillham, has been problematic but seems to be improving in recent years.

Mac is building 3 new apt. buildings on Armour (also market rate), and there is already not enough off-street parking.  Although a nursing home and a group home for people with developmental disabilities have been returned to large single family homes in the last several years, there are still houses and buildings that serve as transitional housing for people in substance abuse recovery, families experiencing homelessness, and people with mental health concerns.  There are 3 liberal mainline Protestant Churches, two of which provide office space for worker's rights nonprofit organizations, and all three provide services to low income people in the community and also welcome people who identify as LGBT.  Al-Inshirah Islamic Center is in this community.  Kansas City Public Schools are improving, but that's not well known, and charter and private schools still draw students away from KCPS.  Academie Lafayette French Immersion Charter School and Notre Dame de Sion Lower School are in the community.  The Nelson Atkins Museum of Art is in the generally affluent Rockhill neighborhood.

Median income is  about $50,000.  Residents generally support expanding access to health care and the rights of workers, women, people with disabilities, and members of ethnic and racial minority groups.

They include close attention  to state and local issues, as evidenced by strong turnouts at town hall and community meetings hosted by elected officials and community leaders. Infrastructure is a major issue because broken sidewalks or no sidewalks proliferate, and potholes appear regularly on the streets. There is intense interest in public, charter and private education and close attention to the Kansas City Public School District, even from neighbors who don't have children there. A committed group of parents worked hard for the reopening of a public K-5 school a few years ago and it has been a huge success. There is strong advocacy for good public transit and strong support for the extension of the downtown trolley line, which will now extend to the University of Missouri-Kansas City. Many educators and graduates of this this four-year school live in the community. The Trolley Trail, which runs the length of the map, is popular among runners, joggers, walkers, bicyclists and dog walkers. Faith is important as houses of worship of several religions and denominations are represented.

School system attracts quality teachers, board of education has won several statewide awards for its leadership. Nixa was formerly a sleepy, small town but for last 35 years has grown to a mix of \"hometowners\" and people who work in Springfield, about nine miles to the north. This growth is due to excellent public schools and rapid housing development  In the 1990s Nixa school district was fastest growing school district in Missouri. Today, growth has slowed a bit--but not much. City government has been future oriented: Nixa Public Building Corporation was established about 1990 to issue bonds for a much-needed new City Hall; a fee was created whereby landlords pay for a city inspection each time the tenant changes making sure the rental is safe and meets building codes; Nixa City Council imposed a facial mask requirement during Covid that withstood some public opposition. County government has a history of cooperation with Nixa, one of the two largest cities in the county, especially in the area of economic development. City of Nixa has successfully courted gigabit speed internet for residents and business. The City purchases power from a 72-acre solar farm constructed in 2017. Nixa struggles to attract new business though a newly reenergized Chamber of Commerce is helping. The Nixa region considers itself autonomous in spite of its dependence on Springfield and Greene County for health care, higher education and entertainment. Residents of the Nixa region are proud to be Christian Countians. In spite of progressive accomplishments, residents are solidly conservative in politics and most are likely church-goers who declare as Christians.","city":"Nixa/Christian","classified":[],"done":false,"individual_position":46,"labels":[],"link":"https://districtr.org/COI/26154","num_areas":1.0,"person":0,"state":"MO","text":"Greater Nixa is anchored by an outstanding public school system, which is the focus of my map.","title":"Greater Nixa","type":"coi","person_last_classified":5}

Most of these are middle income renters that are fundamentally well settled and not loud raucous people.  This is an artful commingling of peoples; due to the presence of the Kansas City Art Institute, the Nelson Atkins Museum of Art,  the Kemper Gallery of Modern art and the near proximity to the Country Club Plaza commercial district.  Amenities here abound and create a well rounded community that is progressive, not afraid of change but is interested in historic preservation of older properties.  To protect the ongoing new developments along Main Street and Broadway this neighborhood should be established as a Local Kansas City Historic District.  This would help to alleviate the growing friction between new construction  and the older housing/ commercial building fabric of the neighborhood.

The community is car dependent with limited transit availability and a few bike trails or sidewalks. Much of the community infrastructure is aging with water main breaks, inconsistent access to broadband, and roads torn up by utility work and water line breaks. The community is struggling with economic development issues as traditional mixed use businesses in the historic city center struggle and new strip mall developments and business chains develop on the 350 Highway corridor. The community's strong school district is a long time source of local pride and attracts new residents along with relatively affordable housing.

As many residents do not have health insurance or cannot afford to use the insurance they do have, access is an issue. A further issue is the quality of care at our hospital, many folks who are able, get their medical care, especially specialist care, in Columbia or Jefferson City. Rural areas within these two census blocks have internet quality and access issues which affects many of the residents in town by proxy. It is not unusual for residents with internet access to allow their rural friends access to their passwords so that they can come download shows, do computer updates, or submit homework.  Many residents are employed in the service sector, education around town or in nearby towns and those in industrial warehouse or manufacturing jobs in the southwest part of town. Most of the higher income housing is out by the country club and over by Teal Lake. The Teal Lake area is a hodgepodge like the rest of the town. I'm not sure these census blocks are a great way group communities of shared interest as some of it is very rural and some of it is not.

Only one family has small children. My youngest is 13. It doesn't appear that many of us are home very often. We all seem to have more than one job. One of my biggest complaints is the waste management here. We definitely need roll carts. Every trash pick up, there's garbage in the streets and in people's yards because animals get into the bags or whatever. There's a few places you can walk to. There's two liquor stores, a mile apart from each other, in either direction. We also have a new gas station, car wash and one of the said liquor stores. They are rapidly building more apartments in that area, as well. I see people walking in the mornings and evenings. I tend to be out in the mornings, with other dog walkers. We had a garden last year but have been way to busy for that this year. However, the farmer's market is not too far but you've gotta drive there from our neighborhood. The city took out the bus stop in our area, which is unfortunate, especially now that there are more places to go in that neighborhood. It feels like a basic, normal, middleclass neighborhood. We don't go to church and I don't think our neighbors do either. We try to be on rivers and lakes anytime we have a free weekend. We used to grill outside and have friends and family over. We noticed the neighbors doing the same. COVID definitely changed that. We are all vaccinated but we still use caution.  I work in Fulton and have about a 45 minute commute. I think most of the people around me live and work in Columbia. We were pretty close with the neighbors that lived on the other side of our duplex but they just moved and bought a house. It's not a new development. I believe it was probably built sometime in the 80's and has had some renovations. We are renters. I wish we had a fenced in back yard but that's not going to happen until we buy our own home. It kind of feels like everyone living in these duplexes, looks at our housing as temporary, until we find what we want. They're pretty basic but functional.

The area between Troost and Hwy 435 is historically where Black people in Kansas City were confined to due to segregationist housing policies. Still today, Kansas City is racially divided and the East Side is the largest and most central Black community in the city.
