It is the 12th largest city in Ohio. Unfortunately, our population is currently declining at a rate of -0.66% annually and the population has decreased by -4.13% since the most recent census, which recorded a population of 60,608 in 2010. The average household income in Springfield is $51,534 with a poverty rate of 23.14%. The median rental costs in recent years comes to $730 per month, and the median house value is $80,700. The median age in Springfield is 35.8 years, 34.5 years for males, and 37 years for females. A partial demographic of Springfield includes: White: 74.92%, Black or African American: 17.17%, Two or more races: 5.96%. Educationally, 40.18% of the population have attained a high school diploma while 21.96% have attained some level of higher education. Most people work in Springfield, but a large number work elsewhere. Occupations include manufacturing, retail, government, and health care. \nEvangelical Christians predominate yet there a is a large Islamic Mosque and a very active Muslim community. Although Springfield would be considered more middle of the road, more conservative than some counties that surround us, there is some level of diversity which has been accepted and relationships abound across various lines. \nSpringfield has many positive attributes. Uppermost is the many Springfield residents who have deep roots in the community that go back several generations. One can go downtown for coffee, a meal, and a tour of the Heritage Center. We have an excellent library and numerous places of worship. Our heritage as a major industrial city remains evident in our historic area and in our relationship with IH/Navistar. Springfield has segments of our citizens who are passionate about making our city a more vibrant place to live. We have seen the fruits of their endeavors especially in recent years  in their efforts to revitalize our downtown with openings of retail businesses, a new hospital and many art and cultural events that bring people together and provide for both performers and audiences as well. \nSpringfield has a Summer Arts Festival at the Veterans Park (which is part of National Trail Parks & Recreation District) that can boast an  annual attendance of several hundred people 5 nights/week for 4-6 weeks each summer. Other free or lost cost events include our annual CultureFest, the Farmers Market, a global education series implemented after  9/11, and an annual Pride Festival. Many parks and bike trails are available in our community that provide individuals and families opportunities for recreation, to be outdoors, and to learn about nature. \nSpringfield has many citizens who are willing to look at themselves and envision ways to make things better. For example, a \"Beloved Community series\" was brought together in efforts to promote diversity, inclusion, and equity (DIA). We have a Peace Camp for kids every summer that has been in operation for 35 years (with the exception of 2020 due to Covid).   \nSpringfield is also extremely fortunate to have a responsive city government and city officials that recently responded with openness after the murder of George Floyd. Both the city and the county responded by forming police advisory committees. More challenging, yet eventually accomplished was the passing of a non-discrimination ordinance. \nThough Springfield is consistently addressing issues in our city, there are specific areas of ongoing concern.  There historically has been a division between the north end and the south end of Springfield and between the county and the city.  Though we believe the majority of our citizens have many positive attributes, and desire a good quality of life for all, the division between the quadrants is seen as a competition for scare resources and a disparity in growth rather than a shared planning for the common good. More resources tend to be in the northwest quadrant than the others. For example, there was a community pool which was centralized  & easily accessible to many of the citizens of Springfield. It was replaced by an upgraded water park that is much less accessible for those in the southeast and southwest quadrant. Another example of the disparity between sections of the city is the closing of a major grocery store in 2020 which was a great loss for citizens in the southwest and southeast quadrants. Many other concerns which affect the quality of life for the southeast  & southwest quadrants and thus continue to need addressed include poverty, homelessness, gun violence and crime, drugs, public education that is not equitable across the board, affordable and accessible healthcare, and an insufficient public transportation system.  Though Springfield does have many cultural and recreational opportunities, those quadrants with insufficient public transportation or lower income are unable to access these as they would want.\nRecently, a zoom meeting was conducted regarding the gun violence in our city. Participants learned that our police force does not have the financial resources for body cams. \nThe availability of jobs presents another significant challenge. Younger people tend to migrate to Columbus and to other large cities that provide many more opportunities for employment as well as higher salaries. Additionally, Springfield has a significant number of ex-offenders who are unable to find jobs due the \"black mark\" on their record. Increasing the availability of jobs with livable wages and job training is needed to assist these men & women in re-entering the workforce.

It is in the middle of an agricultural region producing feed corn, wheat, and soybeans. Water comes from the Maumee River. There are several electricity windmills which are a public utility. Bowling Green was once an oil boom town in the 19th century. Bowling Green was once called the Crystal City because sugar beets were once a major crop of the region. \n\nFolks work for the university community, faculty come from all over the country to work at Bowling Green. A substantial number of children leave Bowling Green and go elsewhere. The school system is considered pretty good, school board arguments over consolidation of elementary schools, despite there only being one junior high and one high school. Rural folks did not want to pay higher taxes and created a rural/urban divide. \n\nFolks work at the university, in smaller manufacturing centers such as Cooper Tire, folks from smaller towns in Wood County commute into Bowling Green to work. Bowling Green is the county seat of Wood County with a beautiful historic court house. \n\nDowntown Bowling Green is a popular destination. John Kerry and John Edwards came to campaign in Bowling Green. The Downtown region has moved away from retail and more towards an entertainment district. Big box stores have moved in and detracted business away from downtown. \n\nThe Bowling Green Parks Department is well-funded and the parks are well-maintained including a grove of old oak trees. Oldest park includes a public pool with other aquatic centers. Golf course and picnic area is also nearby. \n\nLots of Protestant churches as well as a large Catholic church and parish. The Catholic church has school and there is a conservative Christian school as well. City Council passed a non-discrimination policy for employment and the Christian school came out and prevent us from hiring teachers who adhered to our mission. \n\nThe City Council was about to pass a plastic bag ban ordinance and then the state placed a ban on banning plastic bags. Curbside recycling pickup and curbside composting are in town. \n\nThe on-going issues with the school infrastructure, including being old and have no A/C, a concern with climate change and COVID.\n\n City council is working to make bike lanes more accessible and safer, city historic preservation is a priority, zoning updating is underway, drafting a resolution for a sustainability plan. \n\nThere is no public transportation. There is ride sharing and the University has some bussing. A former Mayor took interest in partnering with the University to have a general bussing system. The University turned down the offer. \n\nDrunk students are the main source of crime, otherwise it is a very safe town. The local paper has suffered in recent years. A local law enforcement officer has been opposing the city's Human Right's Council over discrimination. There have been incidents of discrimination, including discrimination against Black Lives Matter initiatives. The police force has not been helpful to folks who are gender non-conforming. \n\nWater pollution is a concern with the Maumee River with the agricultural areas surrounding Bowling Green. Folks from Toledo have come to Bowling Green to get clean drinking water after incidents in Toledo. City Council does have a sustainability plan to curb green house gas emissions.  People are increasingly concerned with climate change and the weather. Down pours of rain this summer and the region is known as the Great Black Swamp. A lot of the agricultural communities depend on drainage with a system of tiling. \n\nAffordable housing is a problem. A starter home priced home is being outbid by landlords who convert them to rentals for college students.  Affordable housing development have gone up but are separate from the historic downtown, desirable areas. \n\nSocial services: there is a very nice mental health public health agency, deals with a lot of people who would be in need of housing. Opiate crisis has existed in Bowling Green, but has not be in the news much lately.

New Albany has been expanding eastward and there is a lot of industrial development that is eating up a lot of farmland and historical family farms. There is a lot of anger and sadness around the area changing quicker. People feel disempowered about the development process. \n\nBecause it is a township, there is a limit on zoning restrictions. New Albany is annexing lots of land and expanding and has the zoning authority and has been using it for industry. \n\nJersey Township is a conservative area, so there's a lot of Trump 2020 signs still up and Trump is President signs, a lot of Christian signs that are anti-other religions. Thin blue line yard signs. \n\nThere is a community church in historic downtown, but there are several Christian churches. The school district is Johnstown-Monroe which is not a great school district but has been improving as Johnstown is growing. \n\nJersey has a golf course and a ton of auto-body part shops, a lot of horse farms. \n\nPeople commute into Columbus or other Columbus suburbs. A lot of retirees lived in the area or unemployed. \n\nThe Township Trustees don't have a lot of power: Cemetery maintenance, roads and snow plowing, zoning issues come before the Trustees but the annexation process falls out of their power. \n\nElection materials were interesting, folks want Trustees to preserve historic Jersey, but the Trustees don't have power.

Recycling drop-off is another issue in the township. \n\nThere is not a lot of attention from federal or state representatives. Jersey is pulled in to a voting block with Granville which helps.

We are currently all 65+, white, college educated women with a progressive leaning.  Our book group has evolved over the years to discuss books on social and racial justice, as well as environmental sustainability. \n\nOur community is largely the city of Westerville.  Established before the Civil War, (about the same time as Otterbein University), was mostly white, heterosexual, and of  Christian faith. There are many churches in Westerville.  Westerville was a stop on the underground railroad,  a leading force in the prohibition movement with the WCTU. Still today is mostly white, middle to upper middle class but a growing diversity in faith, race, income, and sexual orientation. Still a high value on Public/higher education.  \n\nThere is strong support for the police in the Westerville community and the people in our group feel very safe in the neighborhood but acknowledge that those of other races may not feel that way.\n\nWesterville provides excellent recreational facilities, city parks, walking and biking trails, sports fields, and recreation center and Senior Center.  Participation in team sports is strongly encouraged in youth.\n\nWe value the walkability of Westerville, and the parks and natural areas.  \n\nFreeways are close by making it an easy commute to downtown and the suburbs.  Other than the south of Westerville, it lacks diversity.  \n\nGenoa Township is a mixed bag of rural areas and housing developments without a central area, so Uptown Westerville and Maxtown Road shopping fills that gap.\n\nHuber Ridge is home to present and former members of the book group and friends and part of our Community.\n\nThe issues that need attention from officials include growth and rapid development that is paving over the green spaces we value, lack of sustainability planning, affordable housing, leadership in diversity and social justice, social services, and transportation within the city.

Sustainability.  Diversity. Inclusion.  Access to resources and facilities, programming.  Not a lot of diversity in Uptown.  Officials need to listen to students. Policing.   Physical barriers to green space such as highways.  Bike trails under highways don't feel safe and get flooded.   Access to grocery stores below Rt. 270 in southwest corner.  Food insecurity.  Public transportation issues - maintaining bike paths.\n\nWhat we love about our community - diversity is improving.  Can see the past - still have a few old barns (Everal Barn).

Each individual who spoke during the OCRC session spoke very eloquently and succinctly about the concerns with the current maps as they are. Dr. Vanessa Enoch especially spoke to how gerrymandering has affected my district as she put forth a great deal of time, money, and effort to win, yet due to the gerrymandered district, still lost.  I live in Clark County/Springfield. If I was not as involved as I am in local and national politics, it would be very tempting to just step away and not attempt to meet with or contact my US Congressperson or my legislator at the Ohio level.  I have attended 2 Town Hall meetings with my US Congressperson and left both at the end feeling very frustrated, unheard, and unrepresented. At one of them, he looked at his cell phone much of the time and did not seem interested in opening any dialogue to hear the individuals' concern. For instance, a friend of mine voiced her concern that her son would be turning 26 soon and would lose his health insurance. His reply was simply that her son needed to find a job where they have health insurance.  End of discussion. During his other Town Hall, we were only permitted to place our questions in a bowl and they would choose the question. While I can appreciate a desire for order, this definitely leans the questions in the direction he and his team desire. I have stopped attending his Town Halls as they seemed useless to have my voice heard. II have attended his phone Town Halls yet felt as unheard as in person have been by phone. The attendee is required to talk with his staff beforehand and then the question is chosen for the Congressperson. Before he even takes questions though, he talks at length about 'his' beliefs about the state of affairs in the US, and since he is one of the Congress people that questioned the vote in November, much of his beliefs are not in line with my beliefs or my friends and some of what he says or writes is untrue. This Congressperson has been very open that he is a Libertarian, very conservative, and a strong gun proponent; everything I, and my circle of friends and family, are not. While I do not expect my representatives to be in alignment with every belief I have about the running of our state and country, it is very discouraging to know that none of my requests are even taken seriously. And that untruths are spoken and written to his constituents. My other representative at the state level also has opposite beliefs than my circle of friends and family. He is a strong gun proponent and has been a part of the 'Stand Your Ground' legislation that was passed recently which is the exact opposite of what our state and country needs. Many polls indicate a majority of Americans would like to see sensible gun control measures.  These are but a few of the examples of the ways I feel our representatives certainly do not have my ear or my concerns about our state and country. I realize that the maps may be drawn fairly and there will still be legislators who do not see my world the way I do yet at least it will be clear the decision made was based on the majority of people in that district rather than a district that was drawn to get that politician elected.

I currently serve as the elected Fiscal Officer/ Economic Development Director for Jackson Township, Stark County Ohio and have for the past 21 years. I am also the former Chairperson of the Stark County Democratic Party. I have come to present a map following my consulting with my Democratic Party County, Sam Ferruccio, and his leadership team. That team includes two former Stark Democratic County Party Chairs and one former member of the Democratic State Central Committee for State Senate District 29. The hypothetical Congressional District map that I am presenting includes all of Stark County, all of Mahoning County, and 82% of Trumbull County’s precincts. The district has 788,149 residents, only 892 more people than the ideal 787,257. It is 46.19% Democratic; and is 84.3% White and 10.4% Black. The people in these counties share a common heritage. All 3 counties have their largest ancestry from Germany with Irish, Italian and English ancestry being the next 3 groups in all of them. We have similar educational backgrounds with between 89.4% and 91.6% of those over 25 being high school graduates, but only 18.7% to 24.2% having a Bachelor’s degree or higher. Per capita income in 2019 ranged from $26,935 to $29,945. Most significantly, while in recent decades Ohio overall has gained population and increased job opportunities, these three counties have suffered from a loss of people and jobs, just look about what GM  2  abandoning Lordstown has done. There ar many similarities in job loss by all 3 Counties like the closing of the former Hoover Company, Ford Motors Republic Steel and numerous other steel mills. Also, the outsourcing of jobs from major companies such as Timken Bearing and Diebold to name a few along with all the companies that were selling and servicing these plants. Thousand of good paying jobs that payed enough to raise families were lost for good. These 3 Counties deserve representation that understands and can deal with this major problem. We think that it is highly important that given the wording in the enabling legislation, &quot; The general assembly shall not unduly split governmental units, giving preference to keeping whole, in the order named, counties, then townships and municipal corporations.,” that as drawn, not only are there no split townships or municipalities in the District, The district includes all of the cities Alliance and Youngstown We also want to stress that in these counties 70.7% of the counties&#39; total populations live in townships, not municipalities. This is in comparison to Summit where only 14.7% of the population is in townships and in Cuyahoga in 2010 where it was a miniscule 17,746 people. To those of you who live in larger counties this may be no big deal. However, to the 70% of us in these three counties who live in the townships it is a very big deal. For example township governmental units to lost out in the last round of federal stimulus funding. There are also differences in taxation that makes our local governments far more reliant on property taxes than municipalities. Those of us who live in these three counties govern ourselves differently than the large counties north of us. In Stark, Mahoning, and Trumbull there is not one township of more than 52,540 people. We like to know our local elected officials instead of having to watch them on TV.  3  We have different concerns. We have issues involving fracking, more so in Trumbull and Mahoning counties. There are no fracking sites in Cuyahoga and only four in Summit. Following the murder of George Floyd there was civil unrest and looting in Cuyahoga; in Stark, Mahoning, and Trumbull there were only peaceful demonstrations. Due to poor air quality vehicle emissions testing is required in Cuyahoga, Summit and five other counties near Cuyahoga, but that is not required in Stark, Mahoning, and Trumbull. According to the Ohio Attorney General’s Office (1/11/21) Mahoning and Trumbull were among the 10 counties that had the highest rate of opioid overdose deaths in the last quarter of 2020, Cuyahoga and Summit were not. The people in Stark, Mahoning, and Trumbull statistically are very similar; and at the same time are dissimilar to the larger counties to the North. We should be together in one district not divvied up like jigsaw puzzle pieces to meet population requirements of other areas. We don’t belong in a district where the vote is mostly in the Cleveland suburbs or one that includes 7 rural counties and the rural parts of three others. Having a Congressman who understands and has lived his constituents’ life experiences and understands the issues and concerns of the people in their districts is important. In Stark County except for 21 of our 274 precincts we currently do not have that. Despite the fact that the U. S. OMB does not consider Stark a rural county, in 171 of our 274 precincts our Congressman is a farmer from Homes County who used to be President of the Ohio Farm Bureau. He represents us in name only. In the other 91 precincts, only three of which are in a city, we have the former pro football player from Rocky River (67 miles away) ,who is the privileged son of a multimillionaire owner of 7 companies in the steel industry. Again we are represented in name only.  4  When you make your recommendations please remember the people of Stark, Mahoning, and Trumbull Counties; and please help us get a Congressman who will actually represent us.
