This map focuses on a tiny, unincorporated village in Wisconsin known by US Census as Helenville. It is intended to be a portion of a larger map that represents the Rock River Basin Watershed in Wisconsin. For any small, remote, rural village, travel to available community business and professional services is of major concern. At a minimum, these include groceries, healthcare, employment and education. For remote villagers, travel to these resources is one definition of what defines their community and creates a region of common concerns. Consequently, this initial draft focuses on identifying the surrounding communities supplying community services to Helenville. The \"important places\" represented by dots outside of Helenville are focused on grocery, healthcare, employment, education and Town and County government location. \n\nPolitically, Helenville is located in Ward 1 of the Town of Jefferson, Jefferson County, Wisconsin. To the west is Ward 2 of the Town of Jefferson. To the North is the Town of Farmington. East is the Town of Sullivan. South is the Town of Hebron. Public school education is located west, in the City of Jefferson. Geographically, Helenville is located in the east Rock River Basin. The closest business and professional services for Helenville are found in three Rock River communities to the west, Johnson Creek, Jefferson and Fort Atkinson.  Due to HERC membership, secondary and tertiary healthcare is largely west to Madison or occasionally east to Milwaukee. Commuting for work may reach west to Madison, north to Watertown, east to Milwaukee, south to Whitewater or southwest to Janesville. Political representation for tiny Helenville and Surrounds is split into two State Assembly Districts and two State Senate Districts, all of which project into Jefferson County from wealthier, highly-developed counties to the east.

The Watertown COI was first settled by German immigrants in the mid 1800s.  The City of Watertown now has a population of more than 24,000 residents.  Watertown and the surrounding areas are heavily influenced by strong religious ties, with numerous churches and church schools.   \n\nWatertown has had a strong commitment to education and is nationally known for having the site of the first kindergarten.  The Watertown Community of Interest (COI) is home to Luther Prep High School, Maranatha University, eleven private and parochial schools, and seven public schools in the Watertown Unified School District serving students in grades pre-kindergarten through high school.  Maranatha University over the years has made it their mission to become more involved in the Watertown community.  For example, they will often make their facilities available for community meetings and they also offer music lessons to students from Watertown and neighboring communities.  The Lutheran Prep High School has also had a strong influence in the Watertown COI. \n\nWatertown has had a strong reputation for excellent schools for a long time and this has been a significant factor in broadening the boundaries of the Watertown COI.  Children from many outlying rural areas feed into the Watertown Unified School District.  For example, the Watertown School District reaches to the western edges of Ixonia, the southern edges of Clyman, the western edges of Ashippin, and the northern edges of Sullivan, even though these towns are all part of other school districts.  Lebanon is the only town today that has a school system that eventually feeds into the Watertown Unified School District.  Years ago, families in the rural farming regions around Watertown would strive to make their land contiguous with land that was part of the Watertown school district, which would then allow their children to attend the Watertown schools.  As a result, the Watertown School District includes very large rural areas that stretch to the edges of these other communities.  This has been a significant factor in enlarging the Watertown COI over time.\n\nAnother factor contributing to the breadth and strength of the Watertown COI is the abundance of natural resources.  There are numerous parks and wildlife areas in the Watertown COI.  The Rock River is one of the central resources that bends and winds its way around and through the Watertown area, giving rise to many parks and recreational areas.  This has led to the branding ‘A River Runs Through It’ for the Watertown area.  The meandering of the Rock River has also led to some actual islands within the Watertown area that are rather unique.  The Riverside and Brandt Quirk Parks in particular are today very popular for community gatherings and festivals.  \n\nIn recent years Watertown has changed in ways that are impacting the identity of the community. Steady growth in Watertown is averaging nearly 1.5% per year, with increasing numbers of students enrolling in the Watertown schools.  As a result, a number of sub-divisions have been developed in recent years, particularly around the western portions of Watertown.  These western parts of Watertown continue to be active areas for housing development, especially near the intersections of Hwy 26 and Hwy 19.  State Hwys 19, 16 and 26 provide quick access to neighboring communities and to the I94 system.  This has encouraged steady residential and industrial growth in the Watertown COI.  Today there is a mixture of citizens who either work right in the Watertown COI or commute to surrounding cities and towns, including Janesville, Milwaukee and Madison.  \n\nAlthough the Watertown COI is unique in that it is part of both Dodge and Jefferson County, this has not created notable divisions in the community.  Given the growth and breadth of the Watertown COI, there are many people who come to the Watertown area for recreation, employment or other community interests from outlying communities like Lake Mills, Jefferson, Marshall, Reeseville, and Johnson Creek.  The Watertown YMCA, which is associated with the Oconomowoc YMCA, is a good example of a strong nonprofit organization that draws children and adults from surrounding areas who participate in numerous recreational and community activities.  The Watertown COI is a good example of people who have many common interests today stemming from a rich history of collaboration and development.    \n","classified":[],"cluster":"B1","districtr_id":"28718-1","done":false,"individual_position":73,"labels":[],"person":3,"plan_id":"c1185-1","portal_url":"https://portal.wisconsin-mapping.org/submission/c1185","pseudo_coi":false,"state":"WI_20210901_geo40_cluster_B1","submission_text":"The Watertown COI is in large part defined by the Watertown Unified School District and outlying rural areas adjacent to the district.

In addition to the Waterloo School District comprised of an Elementary, Middle and High School, there are also two private schools; the Holy Family Catholic School and the St John Evangelical Lutheran School.   Waterloo also has a historic district.\nThe Waterloo Downtown Historic District is a 5.2 acres historic district which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. The district is made up of the old downtown of Waterloo, including the 1874 Italianate-styled Muebus & Fiebeger's Double Block, the 1885 Brandner dry goods store, the 1893 Queen Anne-styled Doering Block,  the 1896 Becken's Saloon, the 1897 Failinger general store, the 1923 Neoclassical Community Hall, the 1924 Colonial Revival-ish Stoke Brothers Auto Filling Station, and the 1938 Arte Moderne Mode Theater. \nDuring its eastward journey, the Menasha River forms two large ox-bow bends that are located near the center of what is now the downtown of the city of Waterloo. The smaller and the easternmost of these bends is bisected from north to south by Monroe Street and from east to west by Madison Street. These streets have historically been the principal routes into and out of the city (Monroe Street becoming State Highway 89 and Madison Street State Highway 19 outside of Waterloo). The gradual concentration of commercial activity around their point of intersection resulted in their becoming the commercial center of Waterloo..\nThe city is the headquarters for Trek Bicycle Corporation and Van Holten Pickles.  Waterloo was formerly the headquarters of Perry Printing, later called Perry-Judd.  \n\nGiven its poximity to Hwy 19 and I94 that reach conect to other neighboring  communities quite easily, citizens of Waterloo do often travel to other neighboring communties for employment and shopping like Marshal, Watertown, Sun Praire, Madison and other towns along I94.\n\nSome principal annual events in the Waterloo COI include:\n•\tWiener and Kraut Day\n•\tFireman's Park 4 July\n•\tChristmas Holiday Parade\n\nWaterloo has an abundance of natural resources, including many parks and waterways.  The Waterloo Regional Trailhead serves as a gateway to the Glacial Heritage Area. Located in Jefferson County and surrounding areas, The Waterloo Regional Trailhead and the rest of the sites within the Glacial Heritage Area are prime locations for recreation, whether it be bicycling, canoeing, paddling, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, horse-back riding, or wildlife viewing.\n\n","classified":[],"cluster":"B1","districtr_id":"29465-1","done":false,"individual_position":78,"labels":[],"person":3,"plan_id":"c1280-1","portal_url":"https://portal.wisconsin-mapping.org/submission/c1280","pseudo_coi":false,"state":"WI_20210901_geo40_cluster_B1","submission_text":"The Waterloo COI has strong connections given its abundance of schools, churches, natural resource and some larger industries like Trek Bycycle.

Retail and services are available in the City of Elkhorn, although there is a the La Grange-Lauderdale volunteer Fire Department.  Many Illinois families have 2nd homes here. Overall, this township is more affluent that most other rural Walworth County municipalities.","person_last_classified":2}
