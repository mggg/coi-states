4,40,https://districtr.org/plan/24294,plan,,WI Congressional Districts Methodology,"Since this plan still uses old census data, the methodology used to create it is more important than the result. However, the  population deviation result was good, 0.37%. In this methodology, high population counties in Wisconsin were ignored until all the low population counties were selected in their entirety. The result was that only six counties were split: 2 counties in Milwaukee Metro; 1 in Madison Metro; 2 in La Crosse metro; and 1 in Green Bay metro. Resulting county border towns between Congressional Districts were united by their municipal borders and merged with the ""majority"" county. That maneuver in the methodology pushed all the difficult decisions to the remaining metropolitan areas that needed to be split in order to balance populations. Each metropolitan area presented different challenges. Milwaukee area needed support for the large minority population. Madison area (and municipality) needed to be split in order to create compact districts in the southern region. Both LaCrosse and Green Bay areas were split primarily to balance populations. When counties were split, both municipalities and school districts were respected as much as possible, with municipalities respected more than school districts. All of these county splits created difficult compromises that had to be considered. The next challenge is to create a methodology to create a State Senate map that minimizes the number of people who get shifted from a Congressional District in this map to a Senate District and Assembly District collection that they don't share with many other of their Congressional District voter colleagues!",,,,Helenville

6,76,https://districtr.org/plan/25143,plan,,WI Senate Districts Methodology,"This ""WI Senate Districts Methodology"" plan inherited the eight Congressional District outlines from the previously posted ""WI Congressional Districts Methodology"": https://portal.wisconsin-mapping.org/submission/p40    In order to accommodate the 33 state senate districts in Wisconsin within the eight state congressional districts, a specific strategy was used. The extra state senate district was placed directly over the State Capital in Madison. Then, the population used for the extra district inserted into Madison was used to distribute eight, equal segments of population into the remaining outlines of the original eight districts, making eight regions of about 701,000 each. This required minor adjustments in the borders of each of the eight districts significant focus on the priorities of county lines, municipal lines, and some school districts. Finally, each of the eight new regions was exactly filled with four new Senate Districts. The result was that the majority of Congressional District voters would experience no mismatch between the one to one relationship of a Federal House Representative and the four apportioned State Senators. Of course, the methodology for assigning three State Senate Assembly Districts to each State Senate District would proceed, as it always has, with attention to County and Municipal borders as well as other important local borders. These results also demonstrate a respectable 0.8% Senate District population deviation measure and special support for minorities in Milwaukee County.",,,,Helenville

15,1224,https://districtr.org/plan/26477,plan,,County-preserving CD Maps,"The methodology behind creating these eight congressional districts was as follows. CD 1, Congressional District 1 (this is the Districtr numbering), starts in the very southeast corner of the state, preserving Kenosha and Racine Counties, moving westward through Walworth County up to and including Rock County; finally that same congressional district then goes north up the Rock River into Jefferson County.   In creating a CD, the choice of blocks to color is determined by the following priority ranking:  1.	Preserving county lines as far as possible in keeping close to the target CD population; if a county needs to be split, go to the next level 2. 2.	Preserving school district lines as long as possible in keeping close to the target CD population; if a school district needs to be split, keep, if possible, the main municipality associated with the to-be-split school district in the CD being created.   There was no consideration of partisan evaluation made in this process. The most ‘natural’ CD created, CD 1, ended up being one of the more ‘competitive’ districts (with CDs 7 and 8).  This ‘more natural’ CD 1 containing Rock County would go up the Rock River so that it includes Jefferson County following the Rock River upstream. The valley of the Rock River has shallow sand and gravel wells, distributed throughout the basin. Most of these wells are shallower and the majority are domestic with the exception of high capacity wells in the alluvial deposits in Rock County. The shallow wells are susceptible to contamination. Many subdivisions have histories of nitrate and other human-caused contamination. There are also 4 pipelines traversing the CD 1, two carrying tar sands from Canada, going under the Rock River near Fort Atkinson. Lake Koshkonong, a large relatively shallow lake, is just downstream, with surrounding wetlands. Fort Atkinson, Janesville, and Beloit are cities that would be affected by an oil spill by these pipelines. This congressional district is united by its concern for ecological health in the area.

This map is designed for mappers who find the foundation WI Congressional Districts map proposal I used acceptable for State Senate District mapping training (see plan ID p291 ""Prairie Congressional Districts Revised"").   The voters’ best practice theory is that the three State Assembly representatives from a single Wisconsin Senate District should work with the single State Senator from that district. Likewise, the four State Senators from a single Wisconsin Congressional District should work with the single Federal House Representative from that district. Unfortunately at this time, Wisconsin doesn’t support this best practice at this time. In Wisconsin, we have 33 State Senators and only eight Federal House Representatives. This is one more Senator than is required to make this kind of direct mapping possible between four WI State Senate Districts and one WI Congressional District. Perhaps by 2030, this will be fixed. However, it is possible to create this working representation in most WI Congressional Districts now. For the compromises necessary, see plan ID p76 ""WI Senate Districts Methodology"" and plan ID p462 ""SouthCentral Senate Map Methodology.""

Several of our many cold water streams boast Class 1 trout fishing. They include four DNR Creek Fisheries being studied as Exceptional Water Resources. Our county has seven State Natural Areas adding up to almost 4,000 acres of bio-diverse land that give us a glimpse into what our lands were like 200 years ago.   But can we preserve our amazing ecology?  Continuing together, yes!  There is a long tradition here of preventing erosion on our hillsides by strip farming. And family farmers here seem to lead the state in no-till and cover crop techniques. We hold farmers in our hearts during these difficult times.     Recent studies have shown high levels of nitrates in some private wells. Our Karst terrain can be exacerbating this problem with its shallow soil, fissures, cracks and caves. There is high potential for surface water runoff to bypass natural soil filtration bringing contaminants into drinking water.     Adding more deep intrusions into this terrain could increase water contamination. Two kinds of major intrusions are being proposed in Iowa County. And we, countywide, would pay the price.   1) After extensive citizen objections, our Iowa County Board registered its opposition to ATC utilities creating a new high-voltage transmission line that would disrupt our fragile land. Even Public Service Commission (PSC) staff and many conservation groups had recommended local renewable power which would avoid damaging natural areas. Iowa County joined many ratepayers to appeal the PSC decision. Conflicts of interest by some PSC members are part of appeals, which are still pending.  2) A multinational is taking advantage of WI’s lax corporate regulations and approaching individual landowners to sign leases to spread 172 utility scale wind turbines around Cobb, Linden, Mineral Point, Dodgeville, Mifflin, Waldwick, Eden, Highland and Moscow. Foundations for these 650’ tall turbines would be set deep into the unstable Karst terrain.

Iowa County has a long history of economic interdependence. From ancient times Native peoples mined lead found close to the ground surface. In fact Iowa County is thought to be named after a Native Tribe who mined lead from what became the Mineral Point area. Early lead and then also zinc mining brought emigrants from Cornwall, England, from Wales and from Norway to Mineral Point and eventually to Dodgeville.  Mining stopped decades ago, but traditions of carrying Cornish pasties continues in many fundraisers. Many hundreds of mining sites are recorded. Due to the makeup of our land, quarrying for stone foundations and for road surfaces is longstanding and still serves a wide area. The Iowa County courthouse, the oldest, active courthouse in the state of Wisconsin, was built of native limestone by skilled Cornish masons. It is one of many handsome buildings in downtown Dodgeville that date to the 1800s.  Family farming, flour mills, cheese factories, taverns and apple orchards sprang up easily.

The develoment of the Johnson Creek Outlet Mall along with some other larger retail stores like Menards and Kohls  bring people from many surronding large and small communities for work and shopping.  Due to its location, manufacturing and service industries have been moving into the Jonson Creek area as well, including a a few health care clinics.  There is a large AMC Movie Theater in Johnson Creek, which also brings people into Johnson Creek from surrounding communities.  

The Glacial River Bike Trail, the Rock RIver Trail and the Glacial Drumlin Trail all  run through or near Johnson Creek as well, attracting a very large number of outdoors enthusiasts from all over southern WIsconsin to the Johnson Creek area.

230,1185,https://districtr.org/COI/28718,coi,,Watertown Community of Interest,"The Watertown COI is in large part defined by the Watertown Unified School District and outlying rural areas adjacent to the district.  The Watertown Community of Interest is rather expansive and includes Watertown, Pipersville, Lebanon, Ashippun, Clyman and portions of Ixonia.  The Watertown Community of Interest exists in Dodge and Jefferson County, but should not be separated because of this by district boundries.  ","The Watertown Community of Interest is rather expansive and includes Watertown, Pipersville, Lebanon, Ashippun, Clyman and portions of Ixonia.  The Watertown COI was first settled by German immigrants in the mid 1800s.  The City of Watertown now has a population of more than 24,000 residents.  Watertown and the surrounding areas are heavily influenced by strong religious ties, with numerous churches and church schools.   

Watertown has had a strong commitment to education and is nationally known for having the site of the first kindergarten.  The Watertown Community of Interest (COI) is home to Luther Prep High School, Maranatha University, eleven private and parochial schools, and seven public schools in the Watertown Unified School District serving students in grades pre-kindergarten through high school.  Maranatha University over the years has made it their mission to become more involved in the Watertown community.  For example, they will often make their facilities available for community meetings and they also offer music lessons to students from Watertown and neighboring communities.  The Lutheran Prep High School has also had a strong influence in the Watertown COI. 

Watertown has had a strong reputation for excellent schools for a long time and this has been a significant factor in broadening the boundaries of the Watertown COI.  Children from many outlying rural areas feed into the Watertown Unified School District.  For example, the Watertown School District reaches to the western edges of Ixonia, the southern edges of Clyman, the western edges of Ashippin, and the northern edges of Sullivan, even though these towns are all part of other school districts.  Lebanon is the only town today that has a school system that eventually feeds into the Watertown Unified School District.  Years ago, families in the rural farming regions around Watertown would strive to make their land contiguous with land that was part of the Watertown school district, which would then allow their children to attend the Watertown schools.  As a result, the Watertown School District includes very large rural areas that stretch to the edges of these other communities.  This has been a significant factor in enlarging the Watertown COI over time.

Another factor contributing to the breadth and strength of the Watertown COI is the abundance of natural resources.  There are numerous parks and wildlife areas in the Watertown COI.  The Rock River is one of the central resources that bends and winds its way around and through the Watertown area, giving rise to many parks and recreational areas.  This has led to the branding ‘A River Runs Through It’ for the Watertown area.  The meandering of the Rock River has also led to some actual islands within the Watertown area that are rather unique.  The Riverside and Brandt Quirk Parks in particular are today very popular for community gatherings and festivals.  

In recent years Watertown has changed in ways that are impacting the identity of the community. Steady growth in Watertown is averaging nearly 1.5% per year, with increasing numbers of students enrolling in the Watertown schools.  As a result, a number of sub-divisions have been developed in recent years, particularly around the western portions of Watertown.  These western parts of Watertown continue to be active areas for housing development, especially near the intersections of Hwy 26 and Hwy 19.  State Hwys 19, 16 and 26 provide quick access to neighboring communities and to the I94 system.  This has encouraged steady residential and industrial growth in the Watertown COI.  Today there is a mixture of citizens who either work right in the Watertown COI or commute to surrounding cities and towns, including Janesville, Milwaukee and Madison.  

Although the Watertown COI is unique in that it is part of both Dodge and Jefferson County, this has not created notable divisions in the community.  Given the growth and breadth of the Watertown COI, there are many people who come to the Watertown area for recreation, employment or other community interests from outlying communities like Lake Mills, Jefferson, Marshall, Reeseville, and Johnson Creek.  The Watertown YMCA, which is associated with the Oconomowoc YMCA, is a good example of a strong nonprofit organization that draws children and adults from surrounding areas who participate in numerous recreational and community activities.  The Watertown COI is a good example of people who have many common interests today stemming from a rich history of collaboration and development.

Waterloo also has a historic district.
The Waterloo Downtown Historic District is a 5.2 acres historic district which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. The district is made up of the old downtown of Waterloo, including the 1874 Italianate-styled Muebus & Fiebeger's Double Block, the 1885 Brandner dry goods store, the 1893 Queen Anne-styled Doering Block,  the 1896 Becken's Saloon, the 1897 Failinger general store, the 1923 Neoclassical Community Hall, the 1924 Colonial Revival-ish Stoke Brothers Auto Filling Station, and the 1938 Arte Moderne Mode Theater. 
During its eastward journey, the Menasha River forms two large ox-bow bends that are located near the center of what is now the downtown of the city of Waterloo. The smaller and the easternmost of these bends is bisected from north to south by Monroe Street and from east to west by Madison Street. These streets have historically been the principal routes into and out of the city (Monroe Street becoming State Highway 89 and Madison Street State Highway 19 outside of Waterloo). The gradual concentration of commercial activity around their point of intersection resulted in their becoming the commercial center of Waterloo..
The city is the headquarters for Trek Bicycle Corporation and Van Holten Pickles.  Waterloo was formerly the headquarters of Perry Printing, later called Perry-Judd.  

Given its poximity to Hwy 19 and I94 that reach conect to other neighboring  communities quite easily, citizens of Waterloo do often travel to other neighboring communties for employment and shopping like Marshal, Watertown, Sun Praire, Madison and other towns along I94.

Some principal annual events in the Waterloo COI include:
•	Wiener and Kraut Day
•	Fireman's Park 4 July
•	Christmas Holiday Parade

Waterloo has an abundance of natural resources, including many parks and waterways.  The Waterloo Regional Trailhead serves as a gateway to the Glacial Heritage Area. Located in Jefferson County and surrounding areas, The Waterloo Regional Trailhead and the rest of the sites within the Glacial Heritage Area are prime locations for recreation, whether it be bicycling, canoeing, paddling, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, horse-back riding, or wildlife viewing.

A lot of residents are long term/life long residents. 

Farmers are a older population and people in subdivisions are younger population. 

There is a range of socio economic statuses. People in subdivisions are usually moving from Madison. 

Community Concerns:
Proposed Liquid Natural Gas facility is moving in about a mile from the school. 

The pollution of the Rock River. It is on the endangered list. 

There is also a CAFO in the township of Ixonia. Pollution concerns around the CAFO. 

Needing to build a new sewage treatment plant because it is maxed out. This new facility will feed into the Rock River. This will also increase monthly bills for residents.

Madison has the ability to increase sustainability and food security measures via composting, green spaces, polinator areas, and expanding community garden plots. It can also make excellent use of its well developed bicycle infrastructure. ","> Affordable housing: especially around the capital, Isthmus, and UW campus.

La  Crosse has a unique position as it has many physical barriers that limits its urban sprawl. The the East is a bluff range, to the West is the Mississippi River, and to the North is the La Crosse Marsh. Along with this on the western side of the city is downtown which is primarily county and city offices with many small businesses. The limit of urban sprawl does than limit the residential capacity of residents especially students, without having to worry about commuting.  As the urban hub for the county it has the majority of housing unites numbering 51,000. According to U.S. Census Bureau estimates from 2015-2019 of those housing units only 63% are lived in by their respective owners and the gross median rent is $835. This large proportion makes rent and living spaces a large concern for the college community. This problem also expands to the other 7,000 students enrolled at Viterbo University and Western Technical College.  To the North is the city of Onalaska which boasts a large number ""big businesses"" and serves as a large commercial hub. . Due to these  geographical barriers working students must typically commute the drive to Onalaska, this causes the added stress of transportation as the buses sometimes don't run at the appropriate time, so students now have the worry of car upkeep, maintenance and limited routes to reach North La Crosse and Onalaska.

Many offices and classrooms are held in previous residential homes which have since been converted to meet student needs. Since the founding of the University is only 12 years after the founding of the city many of the homes near campus are found to be historical which also limits the potential of expansion for the university. Since its expansion is limited hosuing is a crucial issue to the university as the number of students who want to live on campus surpass the capacity of the dorms.  Due to its historical location, the university works closely with the city government to maintain the historical aspects of  each historical building that it owns. Also due to its proximity to these neighboring residential homes Carroll holds itself to the standard of serving as a center for the community.The university is split into two different wards and would like to work to ensure that all undergraduate students have the ability to vote at the same polling places, as students tend to travel with friends rather than independently on their own.

This COI is surrounded by a substantial number of natural resources including parks, waterways, and wildlife areas. The Glacial Drumlin Trail runs through the entire area into Waukesha and attracts many people from outlying areas.  Residents in this COI has a mutual strong interest in the protection of these natural resources.  Sullivan is also the home of a National Weather Service foreast office MKX, which is connected to the Milwaukee Weather Service System.  

Sullivan is located right on Hwy18, a high utilized state highway which has contributed to keeping the area economically healthy. All the towns in this COI are relatively close to the interstate I94 as well.   These key transportation highways have helped sustain small industries and businesses over time.   Main St is the central part of the Village of Sullivan, containing several bars/restaurants and a number local small businesses.  The local Gaugert’s gas station is a very active gathering place on Main St, serving food, supplies and gas.

Significant retired community and young families. 

School system serves lower socio-economic students. Teachers/staff are dedicated to those schools. 

Lots of natural areas in the community that people really treasure. 

Issues/Concerns:
Safety--fear of the police and policing, but a desire for public safety (particularly around public housing areas).
Water quality--there is a of severely compromised water in the parks/lakes/marshes.  People can't recreate. 
Business Development--Businesses are being pushed/priced/taxed out of the area. Lots of gentrification (which is not the character of the Northside). 
Airport--Deafening noise from military helicopters/planes/fighter jets. Unsuccessful campaign to stop F-35. 
Transportation--not adequate bus routes to service the entire community with direct routes to where people need to go. 
High speed drivers--lots of speedy and accidents. 
Higher quality schools--people have a desire for this. More financial resources are need and lower teacher/student ratio.

We are deeply connected by the way we care for this land and for each other.  Bordered on the North by the Wisconsin River, Iowa County’s Driftless Area river valleys, towering rock outcrops and rolling hills foster special care and local pride. Several of our many cold water streams boast Class 1 trout fishing. They include four DNR Creek Fisheries being studied as Exceptional Water Resources. Our county has seven State Natural Areas adding up to almost 4,000 acres of bio-diverse land that give us a glimpse into what our lands were like 200 years ago.  But can we preserve our amazing ecology? Continuing together, yes! There is a long tradition here of preventing erosion on our hillsides by strip farming. And family farmers here seem to lead the state in no-till and cover crop techniques. We hold farmers in our hearts during these difficult times.  Recent studies have shown high levels of nitrates in some private wells. Our Karst terrain can be exacerbating this problem with its shallow soil, fissures, cracks and caves. There is high potential for surface water runoff to bypass natural soil filtration bringing contaminants into drinking water.  Adding more deep intrusions into this terrain could increase water contamination. Two kinds of major intrusions are being proposed in Iowa County. And we, countywide, would pay the price. 1) After extensive citizen objections, our Iowa County Board registered its opposition to ATC utilities creating a new high-voltage transmission line that would disrupt our fragile land. Even Public Service Commission (PSC) staff and many conservation groups had recommended local renewable power which would avoid damaging natural areas. Iowa County joined many ratepayers to appeal the PSC decision. Conflicts of interest by some PSC members are part of appeals, which are still pending. 2) A multinational is taking advantage of WI’s lax corporate regulations and approaching individual landowners to sign leases to spread 172 utility scale wind turbines around Cobb, Linden, Mineral Point, Dodgeville, Mifflin, Waldwick, Eden, Highland and Moscow. Foundations for these 650’ tall turbines would be set deep into the unstable Karst terrain. This “Uplands” wind project is dependent on the proposed ATC transmission line still in the appeals process. After meeting with residents in opposition, Iowa County legislators have called on Governor Evers to hold a hearing on the subject.  Many of us engage in hands on conservation work. We volunteer in groups like Friends of the Ridgeway State Natural Area, Friends of the Military Ridge State Trail, the Driftless Area Land Conservancy, Bethel Horizons Camp, Prairie Enthusiasts, Kiwanis’ Clean Boats/Clean Lakes and more.  Iowa County has a long history of economic interdependence. From ancient times Native peoples mined lead found close to the ground surface. In fact Iowa County is thought to be named after a Native Tribe who mined lead from what became the Mineral Point area. Early lead and then also zinc mining brought emigrants from Cornwall, England, from Wales and from Norway to Mineral Point and eventually to Dodgeville. Mining stopped decades ago, but traditions of carrying Cornish pasties continues in many fundraisers. Many hundreds of mining sites are recorded. Due to the makeup of our land, quarrying for stone foundations and for road surfaces is longstanding and still serves a wide area. The Iowa County courthouse, the oldest, active courthouse in the state of Wisconsin, was built of native limestone by skilled Cornish masons. It is one of many handsome buildings in downtown Dodgeville that date to the 1800s.  Family farming, flour mills, cheese factories, taverns and apple orchards sprang up easily. We still enjoy these and crafts such as carpentry, architecture, fiber arts, pottery, painting, making music and drama. We also gather for biking, hiking, music, dance, arts.  We have a common ethic of helping each other out. All eleven Fire Departments of Iowa County are volunteer and they work with each other. We support a joint volunteer Iowa County Technical Rescue Team to assist local EMTs, police and fire departments in more difficult rescues.  Iowa County has eight public libraries who work together for library access for all residents. Their outreach includes many additional Pop-up libraries.  The Dodgeville Public Library is currently training volunteers to provide hours of library service within the Ridgeway Community Center. The Dodgeville Chronicle and The Democrat Tribune newspapers help us hear from each other.  Upland Hills Health is our community hospital with a volunteer board of directors representing our local areas. It is a critical access hospital that also has seven family medicine clinic locations and a Nursing and Rehab Center. Other exercise and wellness opportunities are posted with the county. A Meals on Wheels program is active with volunteer support.  Thirty one congregations are listed at https://www.iowacounty.org/religious-institutions. They are active in the community, opening their doors in service. One example is the Wednesday evening Feeding Friends meal. A large number of congregations, PTO's and civic groups take turns bringing the various foods for the particular menu and sit down and eat with those who come for the meal.  Farmers Markets are held on Saturdays in Dodgeville, Saturdays in Mineral Point and Sundays in Ridgeway. We cherish our grocery stores and their cheese and meat counters in Dodgeville, Mineral Point and Hollandale. The Uplands Garden Club meets in Dodgeville and on sites of member gradens. There is a new Garden and Nature Club in Ridgeway. Besides, native plants at the village signs, this club is doing amazing, innovative work of enhancing native species around a fairly new retention pond. This helps habitat for beneficial wildlife. Permanent benches are placed for contemplation.  The historic venues that we visit and show visitors include Taliesin, House on the Rock, Hyde’s Mill, Folklore Village folk art, American Players Theater, Shake Rag Alley art education center, Pendarvis Historic Site, Botham Vineyards & Winery, Spurgeon Vineyards & Winery, Nick Engelbert’s Grandview, the White Church Theatre Project and the Mineral Point Opera House, among others.  Finally, we understand that even as a county, we are not an island onto ourselves. Many of us communicate through broader groups like the WI League of Municipalities, UW Extension, the Regional Plan Commission, the Fair Maps Coalition and Wisconsin Network for Peace and Justice.  You can see my video on advocacy for Restoring Fair Taxes and Increasing State Aid to local governments at https://youtu.be/wWJB-jwZW-Y.  You will notice how small rural communities are in pain from the tragic closing of some of their school buildings due to reduced state aid for education.

Iowa County has a long history of economic interdependence. From ancient times Native peoples mined lead found close to the ground surface. In fact Iowa County is thought to be named after a Native Tribe who mined lead from what became the Mineral Point area. Early lead and then also zinc mining brought emigrants from Cornwall, England, from Wales and from Norway to Mineral Point and eventually to Dodgeville.  Mining stopped decades ago, but traditions of carrying Cornish pasties continues in many fundraisers. Many hundreds of mining sites are recorded. 
Due to the makeup of our land, quarrying for stone foundations and for road surfaces is longstanding and still serves a wide area. The Iowa County courthouse, the oldest, active courthouse in the state of Wisconsin, was built of native limestone by skilled Cornish masons. It is one of many handsome buildings in downtown Dodgeville that date to the 1800s. 
Family farming, flour mills, cheese factories, taverns and apple orchards sprang up easily.  We still enjoy these and crafts such as carpentry, architecture, fiber arts, pottery, painting, making music and drama. We also gather for biking, hiking, music, dance, arts.  
We have a common ethic of helping each other out. All eleven Fire Departments of Iowa County are volunteer and they work with each other.   We support a joint volunteer Iowa County Technical Rescue Team to assist local EMTs, police and fire departments in more difficult rescues. 
Iowa County has eight public libraries who work together for library access for all residents.  Their outreach includes many additional Pop-up libraries.  The Dodgeville Public Library is currently training volunteers to provide hours of library service within the Ridgeway Community Center.  The Dodgeville Chronicle and The Democrat Tribune newspapers help us hear from each other. 
Upland Hills Health is our community hospital with a volunteer board of directors representing our local areas. It is a critical access hospital that also has seven family medicine clinic locations and a Nursing and Rehab Center.  Other exercise and wellness opportunities are posted with the county. A Meals on Wheels program is active with volunteer support. 
Thirty one congregations are listed at https://www.iowacounty.org/religious-institutions. They are active in the community, opening their doors in service.  One example is the Wednesday evening Feeding Friends meal. A large number of congregations, PTO's and civic groups take turns bringing the various foods for the particular menu and sit down and eat with those who come for the meal.  
Farmers Markets are held on Saturdays in Dodgeville, Saturdays in Mineral Point and Sundays in Ridgeway.  We cherish our grocery stores and their cheese and meat counters in Dodgeville, Mineral Point and Hollandale. The Uplands Garden Club meets in Dodgeville and on sites of member gardens. There is a new Garden and Nature Club in Ridgeway. Besides, native plants at the village signs, this club is doing amazing, innovative work of enhancing native species around a fairly new retention pond. This helps habitat for beneficial wildlife. Permanent benches are placed for contemplation.
The historic venues that we visit and show visitors include Taliesin, House on the Rock, Hyde’s Mill, Folklore Village folk art, American Players Theater, Shake Rag Alley art education center, Pendarvis Historic Site, Botham Vineyards & Winery, Spurgeon Vineyards & Winery, Nick Engelbert’s Grandview, the White Church Theatre Project and the Mineral Point Opera House, among others.

It is no secret that politicians have historically drawn up districts that would divide communities they may see as opposition. Rather than having politicians who will look out for their best interests decide how maps are drawn, we should have maps based on shared interests of specific geographies throughout the state. This process can be overseen by an independent body that synthesizes information collected by efforts like the PMC. We have enough data to determine maps that would actually help people, especially communities of color, actually be properly represented, but it is a matter of putting that information to work. With the rampant injustices that our communities are facing, we can not afford to wait until the next census to create maps that are just and representative of the people of Wisconsin.",,,,Milwaukee

Maps should also be drawn to ensure that marginalized communities are represented and able to use their collective voice, rather than have it diluted by being split up into multiple districts.

735,1933,,written,,competitive districts help democracy," I believe that gerrymandering is literally STEALING my vote. In the last three state-wide elections the Democrats have gotten around 50% of the vote, but only around 32% of the state legislators.  The other 50% get around 68% of the legislators, so one party has complete control of the legislature, even though they receive about the same number of votes as their opponents. Thus, they can ignore the governors request for special sessions and even ignore considering any of his policies.    He did get more votes than his opponent but becomes almost powerless. Our votes are being stolen.   Fair re-districting would be good for democracy as the best way to win a majority in districts that are evenly divided is to be moderate and willing to compromise. Currently most districts are safe for one party or the other. The primary ends up being the important election. To win the primary you have to cater to those who are further to the left or the right than most people, and when the winners meet in Madison, there is very little common ground to make policy.  The party in power can reward their followers and hurt their opponents. They should be working for the common good.   End gerrymandering.  ",,,,Waukesha

Districts are made up of communities and exploring “cracking cities” is a mockery of that. This lack of ethics is astounding to me. I am deeply disappointed that the Democrat political party did not change the redistricting policy in 2009 when the opportunity arose. In an effort to truly gauge what American’s want, we vote. By gerrymandering our state maps, we don’t get that opportunity because by cracking and packing districts all votes are not weighted equally. For example, we have lax gun laws in WI. Yet most voters when surveyed believe as I do, we need commonsense gun safety. By gerrymandering our maps, we have a minority holding us hostage to a policy most of us consider dangerous. I understand that both parties have been guilty of gerrymandering, so it is time to remove the process from the politicians and return it to the citizens. Fair maps. The time in now.",,,,Madison

This is not representation. Too many districts in this state are heavily gerrymandered and we are giving more power to a select few within our state.

743,1227,,written,,School centered COIs meet all criteria,"As time presses, we want to save ourselves some work by looking at entities that are already mapped and do not overlap. I feel that centering around schools carries a few advantages: I'm using this link to continue:  *School COIs respect contiguity, compactness and preserve most political boundaries, which are all in the First Order Criteria. * For the Second Order Criteria: With a little sensitivity, because we start with COIs that are small enough [Schools:  There are 5,966 public and Private PK-12 schools in WI but 464 School Districts] it should be possible to spread 5.822 Million residents fairly equally over 99 assembly districts, 33 Senate Districts and 8 congressional Districts. [Those are 2019 numbers. We’ll need to fix that later.] * and we should be able to spread these COIs with less than a 1% deviation so as to respect one person-one vote, which is the Third Order Criteria.  * For the 4th Order, which is Partisan Fairness, I don't really have anything, except perhaps that because we start the work without taking advantage of previous election results, and we will probably have a variety of people drawing maps, not just Rs or Ds but Family Party, People's Party, Workers Party, Green Party, Libertarian, you name it, our work should logically result in a less partisan outcome. * As to the ""Additional consideration"", which perhaps should be considered as a 5th Order, the competitiveness is also very important to keep our politicians listening, on their toes. I'm not sure how we would go about setting this in the design itself. I suspect our Districts will be more competitive than what we have now, as these were designed with a partisan objective in mind.   As to the actual nuts and bolts of drawing the lines on the map, if we start with Schools, and Districts [464], the work is already done. Our job would then be to group them in a way that respects one person one vote. We will need to explore the map making tool and become more familiar with it.  ",,,,Wisconsin Rapids
744,1189,,written,,Do not split town's apart,"My town, Marshfield, is the perfect example of gerrymandering in two ways. First, for our state representative, our small town of 20, 000 is literally split in half. We don’t have a person who can speak for our community’s interests in any sort of way. Second, for state senator our community is also split apart. Even though my address is Marshfield, my state senator is in Chippewa Falls! That is over 60 miles away and she has no idea what the needs and issues are for our area. I never go to Chippewa Falls for anything. If I am not in Marshfield, my shopping, kids' sports, eating out, and any other activities are in Stevens Point or Wausau. Districts need to reflect this.    Anyone with a Marshfield address absolutely should be kept together for both state representative and senator. In the past Stevens Point and Marshfield were always together. This makes the most sense because these two communities are closely tied in several ways such a businesses, medical facilities, and university branches. Plus in the future, I think, these two communities will be even more intertwined and we need representatives who understand this.     ",,,,Marshfield

In the same election, Republicans received 48% of the vote for Assembly, but won 57% of Assembly seats. Thus, due to brazen gerrymandering, both houses of the Wisconsin legislature represent only a minority of state voters. When legislative redistricting imposes minority control over the will of a majority of citizens, oligarchy results. Wisconsin's current legislative composition threatens democracy in our state.

763,107,,written,,Iowa County is a Community of Interest,"My community of interest is the entirety of Iowa County. Our geology connects us as a community. We are deeply connected by the way we care for this land and for each other.     Bordered on the North by the Wisconsin River, Iowa County’s Driftless Area river valleys, towering rock outcrops and rolling hills foster special care and local pride. Several of our many cold water streams boast Class 1 trout fishing. They include four DNR Creek Fisheries being studied as Exceptional Water Resources. Our county has seven State Natural Areas adding up to almost 4,000 acres of bio-diverse land that give us a glimpse into what our lands were like 200 years ago.   But can we preserve our amazing ecology?  Continuing together, yes!  There is a long tradition here of preventing erosion on our hillsides by strip farming. And family farmers here seem to lead the state in no-till and cover crop techniques. We hold farmers in our hearts during these difficult times.     Recent studies have shown high levels of nitrates in some private wells. Our Karst terrain can be exacerbating this problem with its shallow soil, fissures, cracks and caves. There is high potential for surface water runoff to bypass natural soil filtration bringing contaminants into drinking water.     Adding more deep intrusions into this terrain could increase water contamination. Two kinds of major intrusions are being proposed in Iowa County. And we, countywide, would pay the price.   1) After extensive citizen objections, our Iowa County Board registered its opposition to ATC utilities creating a new high-voltage transmission line that would disrupt our fragile land. Even Public Service Commission (PSC) staff and many conservation groups had recommended local renewable power which would avoid damaging natural areas. Iowa County joined many ratepayers to appeal the PSC decision. Conflicts of interest by some PSC members are part of appeals, which are still pending.  2) A multinational is taking advantage of WI’s lax corporate regulations and approaching individual landowners to sign leases to spread 172 utility scale wind turbines around Cobb, Linden, Mineral Point, Dodgeville, Mifflin, Waldwick, Eden, Highland and Moscow. Foundations for these 650’ tall turbines would be set deep into the unstable Karst terrain. This “Uplands” wind project is dependent on the proposed ATC transmission line still in the appeals process. After meeting with residents in opposition, Iowa County legislators have called on Governor Evers to hold a hearing on the subject.   Many of us engage in hands on conservation work. We volunteer in groups like Friends of the Ridgeway State Natural Area, Friends of the Military Ridge State Trail,  the Driftless Area Land Conservancy, Bethel Horizons Camp, Prairie Enthusiasts, Kiwanis’ Clean Boats/Clean Lakes and more.   Iowa County has a long history of economic interdependence. From ancient times Native peoples mined lead found close to the ground surface. In fact Iowa County is thought to be named after a Native Tribe who mined lead from what became the Mineral Point area. Early lead and then also zinc mining brought emigrants from Cornwall, England, from Wales and from Norway to Mineral Point and eventually to Dodgeville.  Mining stopped decades ago, but traditions of carrying Cornish pasties continues in many fundraisers. Many hundreds of mining sites are recorded. Due to the makeup of our land, quarrying for stone foundations and for road surfaces is longstanding and still serves a wide area. The Iowa County courthouse, the oldest, active courthouse in the state of Wisconsin, was built of native limestone by skilled Cornish masons. It is one of many handsome buildings in downtown Dodgeville that date to the 1800s.  Family farming, flour mills, cheese factories, taverns and apple orchards sprang up easily.  We still enjoy these and crafts such as carpentry, architecture, fiber arts, pottery, painting, making music and drama. We also gather for biking, hiking, music, dance, arts.    We have a common ethic of helping each other out. All eleven Fire Departments of Iowa County are volunteer and they work with each other.   We support a joint volunteer Iowa County Technical Rescue Team to assist local EMTs, police and fire departments in more difficult rescues.   Iowa County has eight public libraries who work together for library access for all residents.  Their outreach includes many additional Pop-up libraries.  The Dodgeville Public Library is currently training volunteers to provide hours of library service within the Ridgeway Community Center.  The Dodgeville Chronicle and The Democrat Tribune newspapers help us hear from each other.   Upland Hills Health is our community hospital with a volunteer board of directors representing our local areas. It is a critical access hospital that also has seven family medicine clinic locations and a Nursing and Rehab Center.  Other exercise and wellness opportunities are posted with the county. A Meals on Wheels program is active with volunteer support.  Thirty one congregations are listed at https://www.iowacounty.org/religious-institutions. They are active in the community, opening their doors in service.  One example is the Wednesday evening Feeding Friends meal. A large number of congregations, PTO's and civic groups take turns bringing the various foods for the particular menu and sit down and eat with those who come for the meal.   Farmers Markets are held on Saturdays in Dodgeville, Saturdays in Mineral Point and Sundays in Ridgeway.  We cherish our grocery stores and their cheese and meat counters in Dodgeville, Mineral Point and Hollandale. The Uplands Garden Club meets in Dodgeville and on sites of member gardens. There is a new Garden and Nature Club in Ridgeway. Besides, native plants at the village signs, this club is doing amazing, innovative work of enhancing native species around a fairly new retention pond. This helps habitat for beneficial wildlife. Permanent benches are placed for contemplation. The historic venues that we visit and show visitors include Taliesin, House on the Rock, Hyde’s Mill, Folklore Village folk art, American Players Theater, Shake Rag Alley art education center, Pendarvis Historic Site, Botham Vineyards & Winery, Spurgeon Vineyards & Winery, Nick Engelbert’s Grandview, the White Church Theatre Project and the Mineral Point Opera House, among others.  Finally, we understand that even as a county, we are not an island onto ourselves. Many of us communicate through broader groups like the WI League of Municipalities, UW Extension, the Regional Plan Commission, the Fair Maps Coalition and Wisconsin Network for Peace and Justice. You can see my video on advocacy for Restoring Fair Taxes and Increasing State Aid to local governments at https://youtu.be/wWJB-jwZW-Y.  You will notice how small rural communities are in pain from the tragic closing of some of their school buildings due to reduced state aid for education.     Yes, Iowa County naturally connects us as a community of interest by its geology. And we are deeply connected by the way we care for the earth and  for each other ...

766,98,,written,,Political Gerrymandering Must End,"My name is Nichols Troupis and I am a resident of Lake Geneva, WI.   One of the issues that is of paramount importance to me this year is the redrawing of Congressional and Assembly districts. Wisconsin's districts have been some of the most gerrymandered districts in the country for the past 10 years. As evidenced in recent state assembly elections, Wisconsin's population is majority Democratic, yet the majority will has been denied in state government by a form of technocratic manipulation: districts intentionally drawn to give the political minority outsized influence. Republican attorneys have drawn district lines that they know will secure their majority into future election cycles, despite the long-standing Democratic majority.   Wisconsin's population is very unevenly distributed throughout the state; Democratic voters are largely concentrated in Madison and Milwaukee. However, this concentration of Democratic voters, by itself, poses no basis for a denial of the popular will. Several cities, including Madison, have grown at rates higher than the rest of the state in recent years. Wisconsin's population is continually shifting and changing, and many Wisconsinites have found that the opportunities afforded in Dane County surpass many other areas.   This poses a question: Is the state legislature to deny the ""one person, one vote"" principle to the residents of these ""liberal"" areas simply because the legislature does not prefer their politics, their culture, or their institutions? No; each citizen of the state of Wisconsin has the constitutional right to have their vote counted in exact proportion to every other citizen of this great state. Whether one lives in Portage or Madison, Lake Geneva or Eau Claire, the people decide for whom to elect not based on crass geography, but from aligning their will with the policies and politics of particular candidates. Any other basis is an abdication of democratic responsibility. If the party in control of the state legislature finds that it cannot attain a government majority through free and fair elections, perhaps it ought to change its policy proposals.  Political gerrymandering is costing the state of Wisconsin, and the nation at large, its civic culture, its competitive elections, and its hopeful optimism for the political future. It's time to end this unsustainable practice. ",,,,Lake Geneva

Be fair and allow my opinion and my vote to count, as well as others.   Without fair maps, the votes are being gerrymandered. The election results need to be based on every vote being counted. In many states, the state legislature draws the districts and openly does so in order to influence the likely partisan makeup of the legislature, discourage electoral competition and/or generally hurt their political enemies and help their friends. However, goals like those fly in the face of democratic values like fair representation of voters and the ability of voters to influence election results.   Wisconsin's motto is Forward...make sure we keep moving forward by allowing a bipartisan commission redraw the district maps so we can join the other 13 states that have made the move to include fair maps. There are 72 counties in Wisconsin, 55 of the counties have Proclamations to say they want fair district maps drawn.  I want my opinion known and counted that I am for fair maps.",,,,"Kimberly, Outagamie"
776,83,,written,,Politicians must not pick their voters. ,"Voters must pick their representatives.  When elected representatives cherry-pick their voters by drawing district maps based on revealed voting patterns, representative government loses it's most important attribute:  it's credibility.  This is clear when we look at popularity polls showing our legislature is generally among the least popular, least respected institutions in our society today.  Districts must be compact, drawn on geographic centroids, and boundaries must be based on logical, defendable, easily explained and commonly reasonable physical features.  Districts must not be based upon economic wealth.  Above all, districts must not be based upon revealed voting patterns.  Because our representation was meant to be based on population, our districts must be based on the numbers of persons, without regard to secondary characteristics of persons such as wealth, race, creed, or any other.  Correctly done, voting districts reduce the well-known inherent advantage of incumbency.  Elections become more competitive.  More people find they can offer themselves as viable candidates. Terms of service will become limited only by the electoral marketplace.  This eliminates the proposed need for government interference in elections by setting arbitrary term limits into statute.  Term limits are a government distortion of the elections marketplace and are a false solution to the problem of incumbency in the same way government price controls are a false solution to goods scarcity.

Census blocks split by the north and south running line would be in out based on whether 50% or more of the geographical area is in the block.  This would complete the first district and then you would complete the process by proceeding west until you hit the western border of the state, at that point you go up the same amount of census blocks on the western border and proceed east.

The village communities of Palmyra and Eagle in this community of interest are traditionally closely linked despite being separated by the Jefferson/Waukesha County Border. They both share one school district. Both are located near the heart of the southern unit of the Kettle Moraine State Forest which has more than 20,000 acres of glacial hills, kettles, lakes, prairie restoration sites, pine woods and hardwood forests. The Palmyra Community of interest is situated at the extreme upper end of the Scuppernong River and lies about fifty miles from both Milwaukee and Madison. However, most general shopping trips extend no further than the 20 miles to Waukesha or 40 miles to Janesville. Eagle was founded in the 1830s, having previously been part of Mukwonago, and even earlier, it was part of Genesee. Palmyra was a later addition to the area in 1866. From 1870 to the early 1920’s, people from across the country visited Palmyra enjoying the healing waters at the Palmyra Spring Sanitarium on Blue Spring Lake, which is just outside of Palmyra Village Borders. Now, Blue Spring Lake is known for its water ski team, which includes area kids from as far as Mukwonago.  In the late 1950’s the building was razed and the land leveled, but this era helped shape the history of Palmyra.

There is robust local industry in the Palmyra COI, but people commute for work to larger surrounding communities like Waukesha, Janesville and even Madison. The Fort Atkinson Memorial Hospital is a principal provider for people’s health care in the Palmyra COI. ",Palmyra-Eagle Area,5,Jefferson County

Being within the Kettle Moraine State Forest, the Palmyra-Eagle COI has many tourists and recreationally oriented groups frequenting the area.  Surrounding the Palmyra COI are some of the best hiking, mountain biking and Nordic skiing trails in the Midwest, including a 30-mile segment of the acclaimed Ice Age National Scenic Trail. Bicycle touring routes and snowmobile trails lead right into town and miles of equestrian trails, plus a state forest campground just for horse riders, are at Palmyra’s doorstep.  The Palmyra Lions Club holds a fishing clinic to give people of any age the opportunity to enjoy the sport of fishing.  In contrast to forests and waterways, some of the most productive agricultural land in Wisconsin is located just northwest of Palmyra in the Scuppernong Valley.  In the summer, fields of carrots, onions, potatoes, corn and other produce stretch for miles. ",Kettle Moraine State Forest - Southern Unit,5,Jefferson County

Windsor voted to incorporate as a village on November 3, 2015; prior to its incorporation, it was a town, and a portion of the town was a census-designated place. Windsor is a part of the Census Bureau's Madison metropolitan statistical area.

A portion of the former town was part of a disputed annexation by the Village of DeForest. In July 2004 the village and town reached a settlement in which part of the disputed area would be annexed by DeForest and part would remain with Windsor. In addition, the town and village agreed to exchange other less populated land.

The North Shore of Milwaukee is a neighborhood concept that goes back generations. All of the 6 communities on my map are north of the City of Milwaukee, lie entirely in Milwaukee County, and form the cultural and socio-economic transition from the City to Ozaukee County. Four of the 6 communities are on the shore of Lake Michigan; and the 2 communities that are not, are tied to the others via a shared school system (Nicolet Unified).   The North Shore Library (NSL) services 4 of the 6 communities on my map; and the 2 remaining communities are tied to the NSL via the same county federated library system.  All six communities formed the North Shore Fire Department almost 30 years ago. From the NSFD website: ""The North Shore Fire Department was organized throughout the years 1992 to 1994. It was the hard work of many dedicated community leaders, staff and citizenry looking for a way to improve and share services."" In addition, the Police Departments of the six communities on my map (plus Brown Deer) have formed an ad hoc group called the North Shore Police Departments and meet monthly. So, all safety and emergency services in the area coordinate their work via a North Shore group.  Bayshore Town Center Mall, in the heart of my map, also sees the North Shore as one community. From its website: “Bayshore has been serving the North Shore community as the premier destination for shopping, dining, living and working since 1954.” Finally, even the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel sees these communities as one. It publishes a weekly pull out section called “North Shore Now” that encompasses all of my 6 communities.   The North Shore is as cohesive a unit as anywhere in the entire state of Wisconsin: schools, businesses, public services, press all consider it one entity. These 6 communities should not be in separate Assembly districts (as they are now) (splitting a school district, in particular, is absurd!); and they *definitely* should not be in separate Senate districts (as they are now).

Four of the five maps are in the Milwaukee, WI area, and one map is in Eau Claire, WI.  This map is titled ""AAPI: Hmong/Lao COI in Milwaukee, WI"" and covers four communities in which people of Hmong and Lao ethnic descent live in Milwaukee County.  The first Hmong and Lao refugee families settled in Milwaukee after 1975, as a result of fighting for the USA during the Vietnam war, and settled into two main neighborhood clusters. Many of the initial first-generation SE Asian families have since moved from the inner-city neighborhoods to northwest Milwaukee County.  More recently, refugees from Southeast Asia, particularly from Burma/Myanmar, have settled in these older Milwaukee neighborhoods.  An interview approach was used by Lorna Young (AAPI Coalition of Wisconsin Executive Committee Member) in creating these maps, using interviews conducted with AAPI community leaders who are knowledgeable of historic and current trends of the specific AAPI communities of interest. The DistrictR mapping software statistics for “Asians” in the Wisconsin 2020 wards (which we understand is based on ACS 2020 data) were used as a guide in the interviews. In these interviews, we focused on the “qualitative” understanding of the AAPI community leaders on where their communities of interest live and the needs of the people who live in the COIs, as guided by the “quantitative” ACS data currently loaded in DistrictR.  We note that the “Asian” designation in the US Census/ACS is not disaggregated to give visibility to the specific AAPI sub-communities, and one of our goals in generating these maps is to demonstrate the range in the types of AAPI that make up this “Asian” designation. The nature of the AAPI communities is a function of a number of factors, including immigration status (e.g., refugees vs. professional status), generational dynamics, religion (e.g., Muslim vs. Buddhist vs. Catholic, etc.), ethnicity, country of origin, and language/dialect. These maps do not cover all the possible AAPI communities in Wisconsin, but the communities chosen represent a range of recent refugee settlements vs. those who are more likely to live in middle-class neighborhoods, as well as demonstrating the generational dynamics of the initial settlements vs. out-migration of subsequent generations to other neighborhoods.

The DistrictR mapping software statistics for “Asians” in the Wisconsin 2020 wards (which we understand is based on ACS 2020 data) were used as a guide in the interviews. In these interviews, we focused on the “qualitative” understanding of the AAPI community leaders on where their communities of interest live and the needs of the people who live in the COIs, as guided by the “quantitative” ACS data currently loaded in DistrictR.  We note that the “Asian” designation in the US Census/ACS is not disaggregated to give visibility to the specific AAPI sub-communities, and one of our goals in generating these maps is to demonstrate the range in the types of AAPI that make up this “Asian” designation. The nature of the AAPI communities is a function of a number of factors, including immigration status (e.g., refugees vs. professional status), generational dynamics, religion (e.g., Muslim vs. Buddhist vs. Catholic, etc.), ethnicity, country of origin, and language/dialect. These maps do not cover all the possible AAPI communities in Wisconsin, but the communities chosen represent a range of recent refugee settlements vs. those who are more likely to live in middle-class neighborhoods, as well as demonstrating the generational dynamics of the initial settlements vs. out-migration of subsequent generations to other neighborhoods.   While the DistrictR “Asian” population stats were used as a starting point, the interviewees noted that the data for “Asians” may be undercounted, as some of the community members, particularly recent refugees, are suspicious of providing personal information. Also, as recent immigrants, language barriers and confusion/misinformation on the purpose of Census are inhibitors to compliance. As a result, the 2020 demographic data is likely to understate the true population of the various AAPI communities.

The men are mostly factory/blue collar and light industry workers (e.g., Amazon, Pitney Bowes, Palermo's factory).  Key issues: language barriers, adult education/training to diversify employment options, health care access and navigating the healthcare system, expectations and understanding of Western medicine practices, need for transitional services (e.g., volunteer/religious orgs that can cater to their specific transitional needs), literacy for citizenship training, opportunities for urban community gardens and potential farms in the future (many of the older generation are of rural background - rice, farming, etc.; there are currently no Rohingya rural farms in MKE), access to resources to fix up homes.

These two counties make up one vitally important Community of Interest (Combo) that should not be divided.  The entire Adams County and the entire Juneau County should be within the same Assembly District and within the same Senate District.   Special Land, Special Conditions and Special Species:  This Combo has an unusually large concentration of rare species, including several that are globally imperiled.  Species found here include the Massasauga Rattlesnake, Big Brown Bat, Blanding’s Turtle and Four-toed Salamander. Also we have many, many rare birds,  butterflies, dragonflies, fish and plants. The Red-headed Woodpecker is among the species doing well.  Note that our internationally known Necedah National Wildlife Refuge (NNWR) has the largest number of Blue Karner Butterflies in the world. And NNWR was instrumental in starting the Whooping Crane migration project. See https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/landscapes/index.asp?mode=detail&Landscape=5 . Our Combo has more forest cover and more wetlands in large scales than is typical in Wisconsin.  Agriculture was not easy due to this area’s shorter growing season, the poor soil, and the cost of maintaining the extensive ditch system to keep draining it. And thankfully we have not had mining nor exploration for mining.    Most significant is that about one fourth of the Combo is publicly owned by federal, state and local governments. And the Nature Conservancy recognized its uniqueness and partnered with the WI DNR to develop large conservation projects such as Quincy Bluff.  Also, what is privately owned in this Combo is mostly in large sections, making it easy for conservation projects.

Rather the nation owns land in 14 WI counties:  Adams, Clark, Crawford, Dane, Eau Claire, Jackson, Juneau, La Crosse, Marathon, Monroe, Sauk, Shawano, Vernon and Wood.  This is a result of the failed attempts from 1832-1874 to ethnically cleanse the Ho-Chunk out of WI and IL to lands West. But the Ho-Chunk continuously returned here.

It is Jackson County where they have their highest % of  population in WI. Still, the  % of all indigenous in Jackson County is only 5.4%. As for WI legislative representation, their voice is even more diminished by gerrymandering Jackson County and its neighbors. Jackson  County, like Marinette County, and way too many other small counties, has three State Assembly Districts, and furthermore, two different State Senate Districts (not nested). It is time to hear some of  the Sacred Voice of the Ho-Chunk by keeping Jackson County whole.  It is time for more voices to be heard by following our State Constitution by keeping as many counties whole as possible.  Especially keep our small counties whole.

They value respect for land and nature. They travel far to join other tribes to register in public hearings against a hazardous Back Forty Mine.
