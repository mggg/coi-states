I have been a life long farmer growing up here. My Great Grandfather from Germany settled on the southern edge of Palmyra Township in Lenawee where a road is named after the family. My Grandfather established a farm operation in Raisin Township on the border of Raisin and Palmyra Township in Lenawee County. My father with my grandfather established his farm in Palmyra Township on the same Raisin Township border. As a 76 year old life time farmer, I now continue the farming operation my grandfather and father began plus expanding this operation on my own. As you can see I have a great passion for agriculture in Lenawee County and the community I live in. My farming operation does business with agricultural concerns and businesses in Lenawee and surrounding counties such as Monroe and Hillsdale counties. These businesses are seed, fertilizer, and chemical businesses as well as machinery dealerships, machine shops, and welding and fabricating companies. I also rub shoulders with many farmers and ag related business people throughout this tri county area. I am a member of the Lenawee Farm Bureau and participate in activities at the Lenawee County Fair. It makes sense to me that the people in government share my interests and have an understanding of the agricultural world I live in, whether it be my State Representative, my State Senator or my US Congressman. Therefore, I am asking that my concerns are at the top of your list when drawing up districts for all three public offices.

The focus of life is different in the country with farmers meeting for breakfast in local restaurants\n(before the pandemic) to informally discuss farming and local interests before going out to do daily work.
