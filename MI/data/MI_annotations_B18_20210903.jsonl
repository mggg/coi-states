Five counties (Leelanau, Benzie, Grand Traverse, Antrim and Kalkaska) with approximately 172,000 residents has too great a population to be in one state house district. Historical and cultural characteristics as well as economic interests should be considered a “community of interest” and kept together as much as possible when drawing the new district lines. Our five counties have common bonds and comprise a “community of interest” because we share services, a school district, resources, transportation and the identity as being the broader Grand Traverse Bay Area. Groups within the counties are working towards affordable, quality child care across the region. All five-counties have inadequate child care to provide for our growing work force. This five-county area has recently been awarded responsibility for the management of the Tri-Share pilot program to address the scarcity of child care in our region.   \nResidents of the five counties share the following bonds:\n•\ttravel to Grand Traverse County for work;\n•\tutilize the hospital, doctors and pediatricians located in Grand Traverse County; \n\nFurther, we share educational resources:\n•\tNorthwest Education Services is a five-county region of Antrim, Benzie, Grand Traverse, Leelanau and Kalkaska schools.  \n•\tNorthwestern Community College is the area’s post-high school institution.\n•\tMany local service agencies cover all, if not several, of these counties.
