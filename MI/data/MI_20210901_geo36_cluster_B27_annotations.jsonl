We are in the process of updating our maps to reflect population shifts from the 2020 Census, and we expect to have a complete update to our original 237-page report available soon at miaflcio.org/fairmaps. In the meantime, we are submitting this testimony so you have the most up-to-date version of our work before beginning your mapping in these particular regions.\n\nDistrict 18 comprises most of Ann Arbor, Pittsfield and York Townships, all of Milan, most of northeastern Washtenaw County, part of western Canton, and all of Plymouth and the Oakland portions of Northville. This district would bring together much of the Ann Arbor commuter community along both 23 and 14. This district has a high level of educational attainment, and would have the highest AAPI vote share of any district on our map (15.85%). Eastern and western Washtenaw are locally acknowledged regions with different interests, which this district and State Senate District 16 reflect, and Ypsilanti has historically had its voice drowned out by being paired with Ann Arbor, which we have corrected here.

We are in the process of updating our maps to reflect population shifts from the 2020 Census, and we expect to have a complete update to our original 237-page report available soon at miaflcio.org/fairmaps. In the meantime, we are submitting this testimony so you have the most up-to-date version of our work before beginning your mapping in these particular regions.\n\nDistrict 18 comprises most of Ann Arbor, Pittsfield and York Townships, all of Milan, most of northeastern Washtenaw County, part of western Canton, and all of Plymouth and the Oakland portions of Northville. This district would bring together much of the Ann Arbor commuter community along both 23 and 14. This district has a high level of educational attainment, and would have the highest AAPI vote share of any district on our map (15.85%).

Many people in this area commute into Detroit or Ann Arbor for work/business. However, this area has distinct interests from both Ann Arbor, Detroit, and northern Detroit suburbs so I do not believe it should included in the same district as these areas. This area is united by its suburban character, watershed natural resources, and family-oriented activities (kids sports leagues, arts programing).","person_last_classified":2}
