4,plan,ush,,KENT COUNTY-3RD CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT,"JUSTIFICATION FOR KENT COUNTY MICHIGAN IN ITS ENTIRETY BEING THE 3RD CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT  This paper supports making Kent County Michigan in its entirety the 3rd congressional district.  Following are the stated criteria for redistricting in priority order:  (a)	Districts shall be of equal population as mandated by the United States constitution, and shall comply with the voting rights act and other federal laws.  (b)	Districts shall be geographically contiguous. Island areas are considered to be contiguous by land to the county of which they are a part.  (c)	Districts shall reflect the state's diverse population and communities of interest. Communities of interest may include, but shall not be limited to, populations that share cultural or historical characteristics or economic interests. Communities of interest do not include relationships with political parties, incumbents, or political candidates.  (d)	Districts shall not provide a disproportionate advantage to any political party. A disproportionate advantage to a political party shall be determined using accepted measures of partisan fairness.  (e)	Districts shall not favor or disfavor an incumbent elected official or a candidate.  (f)	Districts shall reflect consideration of county, city, and township boundaries.  (g)	Districts shall be reasonably compact.  Kent county especially meets the important “Communities of Interest” criteria for redistricting by the Commission.  Kent County contains the city of Grand Rapids and the suburbs/cities Grandville, Kentwood, Walker, and Wyoming.   Kent County, Michigan's estimated population is 660,560 according to the most recent United States census data.  This is very close to the specified size of a congressional district.  2020 average size target for congressional district nationwide is 775,726.  Michigan population (9,966,555 in 2020 census) divided by 13 districts (one less than current as planned) would dictate an average of 766,658 people per district.  If necessary, borders of the district could be expanded beyond Kent county in any direction to increase population nearer to the 776,658 target.  Suggest that Ionia county (population 64,697) which includes the Grand River corridor could be added as it has the most in common with Kent County.  The county has interconnecting transit services, school systems, freeways and share many community services.  These cities share a water system, sewer system, county services and access to the Grand River and its parks.    The population diversity compares favorably with the state average.  The county is the center of eleven higher education institutions and satellites for the west Michigan region.  Major corporate businesses are centered in Kent county and draw employees from all these communities and thus support the commerce, services and small businesses of these communities.   This area would provide for an approximately 50% split between political party voters.   Currently, these suburbs/cities (Grandville, Kentwood, Walker, and Wyoming) that are in Kent county and contiguous to Grand Rapids are not in the 3rd congressional district.  Instead, population is drawn from the city of Greenville 45 miles to the north in Montcalm county, all the way south to the city of Battle Creek 65 miles away and rural areas in between.  Neither of these areas or the current congressional district rural areas outside the county share any communities of interest with Kent County. "

When I think of west MI, this is what I think of. People within these bounds often travel for work or business; it’s often people from the lakeshore go to Grand Rapids and vice versa. This is the area that shares the same local news, where we travel to see family in, live, work, eat. It’s not exactly defined- some parts such as Plainfield or anything North of Muskegon (I’d say anything north would not be west Mi) could be trimmed out perhaps. The city of Hamilton could perhaps be added in. Again, it’s not crafted exactly down to the street, but when I think of west MI, this is my community I think of.

29,plan,ush,,Cayden Snipes' Districting Plan,I'm from Marcellus which is around the Kalamazoo area in Cass County so imagining of the districts in Detroit may need some editing.  I pretty much drew these maps based off of trying to find a good balance between rural/urban voters as well as trying to divide them into different hubs so to speak. For instance I put counties in my District 1 that I thought were more connected to Kalamazoo as a sort of hub than Battle Creek and so on.   When drawing the districts for the north I thought it wise to essentially give the UP their own representative as their wants and needs may be different than our own down here and some people from the UP have expressed that same opinion. I gave them the tip of the lower peninsula as it contains places such as Mackinaw City which help fuel their tourism industry.    My main idea around the Detroit area was trying to not make a mega district down there so that the more rural people around that area actually stood a chance of being heard. 
30,plan,ush,,Congressional Districts,"My goal was to keep counties together whenever possible and make the districts close in population. Making them somewhat rectangular where possible with district 1 being the exception.

Michigan is a very competitive purple state, so the split between our federal representatives in Congress should almost always be 8-5, 7-6, 6-7, or 5-8, depending on the year. This will ensure that Michiganders send an approximately proportional number of representatives from each party to Congress.

Mount Pleasant is a town of about 26,000, surrounded by smaller rural communities right in the center of the state. We combine the best of small-town life and university amenities. In our immediate area are Central Michigan University, the Saginaw-Chippewa Tribal College, Mid-Michigan Community College, and Alma College. We provide a wide range of higher educational opportunities to local residents, as well as students all over the region and the state. The Mount Pleasant Public School district has a wide catchment area, including students as far away as Rosebush, Lake Isabella, and Shepherd.   You can help us keep our educational community intact by redrawing the 99th district to include these areas. We provide pre-professional studies in health care and a medical school. We offer resources in STEM fields, language, the arts, history, and anthropology.   Combining these communities into the 99th district will also streamline and simplify economic development including public-private partnerships like the CMU Research Corporation. Opportunities for life-long learning and skill retooling support employment needs for both workers and business. Higher education institutions are a powerful economic driver for the state.

I live in rural Riga Township in southern Lenawee County. This community shares so many of the same cultural, economic, and even religious aspects as the other communities in this suggested district. Agriculture represents a major economic driver, along with many of similar industrial operations such as steel. Much of the rural and agricultural community shares similar values making it easy for elected officials to provide fair representation.    Most importantly, these counties already share many natural and community factors. The Region 2 Planning Commission represents a tri-county area consisting of Hillsdale, Lenawee, and Jackson. The Area Agency on Aging, which I have served on, represents these counties as well.  The River Raisin Watershed displays a natural boundary tying Jackson, Lenawee, and Monroe Counties through environmental shared interests.  Branch, Hillsdale, and St. Joseph County share many of these same interests, while also sharing a regional health department and would be a natural fit to adjoin the already existing relationship between Monroe, Jackson, and Lenawee. Similarly, western Washtenaw shares a makeup of towns and small cities just like the rest of the district and despite the county lines (which my map largely adheres to as to keep matters simple for voters), this area is more similar to the small towns in Jackson, Monroe, and Lenawee, rather than the major metropolitan areas in eastern Washtenaw like Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti.

Living in Riga Township, a border county district makes all the sense in the world due to the health, environment, and economic factors we encounter in our daily life.

Additionally, I kept other communities together such as Grand Rapids, a Lansing-centered district, an ""Up North"" district, a Lake Saint Clair & Thumb district, in addition to the metro Detroit seats.   Keeping the commission's criteria in mind, not only did I focus on communities of interest, but also kept in mind competitiveness of districts (7 districts are extremely competitive -- much more so than our current districts). While drafting, I also kept in mind township and county boundaries to help voters (and clerks!).  I also kept in mind succinctness of the district and with the exception of the majority-minority districts and their neighbors, these districts are visually appealing all with similar populations.  I believe this map checks  the boxes for all the criteria the commission is focused on. While the commission will not make everyone happy, this seems like a just map which accomplishes the goal defined in the Michigan Constitution. "

I thank for the opportunity to write in to ask that you consider watersheds as a community of interest. Often, environmental and economic interests are very intertwined within specific watersheds so having representation accountable to specific watersheds will ensure  that unique needs are better met. If representation at the state and federal level meander across several watersheds, this will dilute our voice and the important work done in our community.  The River Raisin Watershed if about 1175 square miles -- roughly the size of Rhode Island. We contain around 429 lakes and ponds, and we contain 3000 miles of man-made drainage systems. We are comprised of pieces of Hillsdale, Jackson, Lenawee, Monroe, southern Washtenaw, and parts of Ohio. This is a majority rural-area and we work to increase awareness regarding agricultural practices that improve our ecosystem as well as advocate for legislation that may impact an area like ours.  We've worked hand-in-hand with farmers all along the watershed. Through their farmer initiative, they have made great strides in reducing phosphorous content of their fertilizer application and have done everything from building buffer zones which prevent runoff into the streams and the feeder creeks that go into the river. We're proud of the work we've been doing.  Nearby, the Huron River Watershed Council encompasses the Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti metropolitan area and they have their own unique watershed needs, which are very different from our needs. This community deals with issues stemming from urbanized areas -- very important work, but very different work from what we do and what our rural community needs.  Combining these two watersheds would be a disservice as it would dilute the voice of both of these important watershed communities so I ask the commission to keep these vital watersheds  in separate state and federal districts.  I have submitted two congressional district maps that will best follow the watersheds and areas of like-need in the southeast corner of the state. Thank you very much for your time and service."

I previously wrote in explaining the linkage between Lenawee and Monroe counties (comment w316) but I have now drafted a complete congressional district map.  Border counties have a unique interest as states dealing with interstate economic issues. Many industries cross over and areas like Lenawee and Monroe may have more common with an area like Toledo, Ohio, than they may have with Detroit or Ann Arbor or Ypsilanti. As a member of Lenawee Health Network, another important link that border counties have is common is the influx of citizens of Ohio, crossing the border for Marijuana. As stated previously, LHN is concerned about the health of people in the county, and the struggles that people have with drug dependency, something that these other counties will battle as well. It is important to have representation that is able to recognize the unique battle that these border counties encounter.  The other districts were modeled after other maps I have seen in the portal and include two Voting Rights districts. The districts are compact and fairly competitive, but overall, the border county district makes the most sense to me and my map was built off of this district."
96,plan,ush,,Mark's Congressional Districts Plan,"This plan is based on several factors. One of which is to keep some slight resemblance to the last set of districts, to avoid confusion and chaos from the general public. While Michigan has had an unfortunate history of gerrymandering, this map avoids making any sort of district that ""snake-like"" or ""dragon-like."" Rep. Walberg's district no longer has that awkward ""pimple"" consuming parts of Ingham County, whereas Rep. Kildee's district no longer snakes around the Great Bay and suddenly drives directly south on I-75 to Flint. Rep. Meijer's district no longer awkwardly reaches over to Marshall and Albion. And yet so many districts looks pretty similar, such as the districts with the Thumb, the U.P., and in Southwest Michigan. I wanted to ensure that the districts looked like they were mainly considered as based on population, while avoiding any sort of ""slithering"" or ""reaching over"" portions. I also slightly considered some aspects of culture/regional makeup for this map. It's safe to say that the counties, cities, and townships that make up these districts are all relative to their regions' respective histories. The tri-counties in the Great Bay district share a wealth of culture and history, similar to the counties ""Up North"" historically belonging to districts that contain the Upper Peninsula. And while working with/around Detroit was the more 'difficult' portion of making this map, it proved to be pretty effective when considering what parts of the city relate to their respective districts (e.g. Southwest Detroit being similar to Dearborn, Downriver, and other Wayne County communities, or the Grosse Pointe communities having shared histories with Detroit's eastside and southern Macomb County). Again, the main purpose of this plan was to base it predominately on population without slithering or jutting any section out to make it look, shall we say, ""shady."""

Growing up in Lincoln Park (a Downriver community), I am very familiar with the lifestyles and economics that define the area. It may be a surprise to some, but the Downriver area relates far better to Monroe County as suburban versus the urban City of Detroit areas. I started my family in the Plymouth/Canton area and can attest that this area is far more similar to suburban Wayne than Detroit. Having lived in a number of areas in Wayne County, I am familiar with a region in the county that has a large population of residents of Arab American descent. Their community is vibrant, unique and deserves the opportunity to have a State Senator that represents them.  I now live in Southeast Jackson County and, as a concerned resident, I decided to attend the Jackson public hearing.  We live in what is known as the Irish Hills. The Irish Hills region encompasses Jackson, Hillsdale, and Lenawee counties. I spoke about the importance of keeping Jackson County whole. I currently serve on the Jackson District Library, which is countywide, consisting of 13 branches, and we provide adult services, community engagement, youth programing, and literacy outreach throughout the county.  Throughout the Jackson public hearing, I heard from most in the audience the need to recognize rural and urban areas separately. The maps that I drew across Southern Michigan recognize the division of urban and rural regions into separate senate seats, and even create a Greater Lansing senate seat.   Additionally, while working as an assessment developer at the University of Michigan, I had the unique opportunity to observe the singular connection between Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti.

Jackson ended up with Ann Arbor, and Battle Creek with Kalamazoo. And I think that makes sense.   4 ended up reaching all the way to Port Huron, which I think works, because that unifies the Thumb counties (Huron, Sanilac, Tuscola, Lapeer, St. Clair) into one district.  8 is a little weird, because Ingham/Livingston/Clinton/Eaton aren't quite enough people. I added Gratiot and Shiawassee to round out the district.  5 starts out easy (Genesee and Saginaw Counties, plus northwestern Oakland) but the actual border between it and 9/10/11 is tricky. I ended up using school district boundaries - Clarkston, Holly, and Oxford are in 5.  10 was frustrating. Macomb County is about 80,000 people too big to be a district by itself. Again I ended up using school district boundaries to figure out the border with 9. I put Utica in 9 because of the similarities between Troy/Rochester and Sterling Heights/Utica/Shelby, but that made 9 too big, so I gave 10 the Hazel Park, Madison, and Lamphere districts (due to their similarity to Warren).   Once all that was done, the border between 9 and 11 was pretty easy - just the western boundary of Southfield/Bloomfield Township/Pontiac/Orion Twp.   12 and 13 are majority minority. I tried to give them logical boundaries. The City of Detroit is divided along Livernois Avenue. I put the communities along the Detroit River/Lake St. Clair in 13, since that's a community of interest in my mind. And then I had 12 follow the I-94 corridor. 12 got some of Monroe County (basically the Airport School District) because 7 was too big.   Hope this helps the Commission!

Southeastern-most district, comprised of the city of Southfield and the municipalities which grew from old Royal Oak Township is quite logical, as the Southeast former-Royal Oak communities (Modern Royal Oak township, the City of Royal Oak, Madison Heights, Pleasant Ridge, Huntington Woods, Berkley, Ferndale, Oak Park, and Hazel Park) all have a strong historical tie, and are all connected either via the Woodward Corridor, or the John R corridor. They are a reasonable fit with Southfield due to their relative diversity, and reasonably large working-class communities concentrated on the 8 Mile and Dequindre corridors.   The district directly above it combines the reasonably affluent Southfield Township with highly similar Birmingham, Bloomfield Hills, and Bloomfield Township. This district then extends East and West to take in Troy, Clawson, and Greater West Bloomfield. Troy and Greater West Bloomfield are all quite diverse suburbs, with Troy having a high South and Southeast Asian population, and West Bloomfield having a substantial Chaldean community, as well as a sizeable Asian, and  considerable Jewish population.   The Northernmost district on this map comprises two primary regions. The first is the Greater Rochester area, which was described by numerous individuals at the MICRC Hearing in Pontiac as consisting of Rochester, Rochester Hills, and Oakland Township. This district then reaches West, to claim Auburn Hills, Pontiac, and Waterford. Auburn Hills and Rochester share the Campus of Oakland University, and Auburn Hills acts as a diverse suburb for Pontiac. Waterford is also a relatively diverse, more working-class suburb which is reasonably viewed as something of a suburb of Pontiac. These two different communities, while not perfect, result in a reasonably compact and highly competitive district.  The final district, made up of Farmington, Farmington Hills, Novi, Wixom, Walled Lake, Commerce, Milford, Lyon, and South Lyon is bound by compactness, and a Community of Interest described by a speaker at the Novi MICRC Hearing. Novi and Farmington Hills have substantial Asian populations, and by keeping these cities together, this district amplifies their voices as a key voting bloc in this highly competitive district. Lyon, Milford, and Commerce are all diversifying exurban communities which are quite similar to each other. Because of the other districts, these are very logical communities to be placed with Novi and Farmington to result in a compact and competitive district.   I believe that this set of four district would be the best map to representing this part of Oakland County in the State Senate."

Also, the district that includes Saginaw and Bay City no longer includes Flint, but opens up the district to a broader landscape that includes the likes of Tuscola, Midland, and Isabella counties. While not perfect, this could be a solid template for future commission members to tinker with in upcoming post-census elections."
130,plan,,,Hooper State House Map I,"Here is my first attempt at a state house districting plan. I did my best to keep communities together, but as you will notice, some had to be broken up due to population restrictions.  In Detroit, I followed the city ward maps when drawing districts. In Grand Rapids, I split the city into North and South, with the western precincts joining the Walker district. I followed the current house plan when drawing Kentwood (which I did not do for the state senate map). The issue with the population numbers south of Grand Rapids is that Wyoming and Kentwood can't go together and keep a nice-looking district. Instead, we can either keep Kentwood with the rural parts of Kent County or the northwest corner of Allegan County. I chose the latter.  I did not want to split Grand Traverse, but I wanted to keep my other districts concise. Otherwise, I would have blocked off Leelanau.  I welcome everyone's thoughts."

The rest of the districts follow municipal, county, and population restrictions. There are two swing districts created (one that covers mid-Michigan and the other that covers the outskirts of Wayne and Washtenaw)."

It is so important that election results reflect the breakdown of the seats.   Some key points from the map > East side of Detroit is connected with all of Downriver's communities (keeping Downriver together is important as they are a community of interest stretching from Ecorse to Flat Rock, mentioned Wayne county hearings as well). This is a dense blue collar district that is also diverse, includes Bengali, Yemeni, Polish, Mexican communities. It is majority minority (45% black and 9% hispanic 2% asian) and is required by the VRA.  > West side of Detroit is together with geographically close places like Dearborn and Dearborn Heights (crucial communities in both that shouldn't be split), Southfield/Oak Park (majority black communities of Oakland county), Redford, Inkster, Garden City and Westland. This district is 55% black and is required by the Voting rights Act.   > Ann Arbor and Washtenaw County is a tricky place since it is not perfectly a community of interest with any place around it. But I choose to keep it with close by suburbs and  in Wayne, Livingston and Oakland County like Canton, Northville, Plymouth, Livonia, South Lyon, Milford and Brighton)  > After being butchered last decade, Oakland County's diverse and affluent suburbs are connected in a compact district that includes Novi, Farmington, Commerce, West Bloomfield, Pontiac, Waterford, Rochester Hills, Troy, Birmingham and Bloomfield Hills. Other exurbs like Oakland township and Orion township are included for population and are a decent fit.   >  Southeastern Oakland, Southern Macomb and Grosse Pointes are included in a district that includes the dense suburbs north of Detroit. This district is crucial to help maintain partisan balance in the overall map. While Macomb county could be encompassed in one district, it would result in a 8-5 configuration for the 2016 election where the winner only won by 0.3%. Additonally, southern half (Sterling Heights, Warren, Mt Clemens, Clinton Township) include large asian, arab, and asian communities that are very different from the very white northern Macomb townships.  > Tri-cities (Saginaw/Bay City/Midland) and Flint are included together. They have a strong economic connection with each other and there are plenty of residents at the Flint hearing who voiced their support for it  > Thumb, which is a geographically recognizable area, is kept together with similar exurbs in northern Oakland and Macomb Counties  > All three counties in Lansing are kept together. However this isn't enough for a full district, for more population I included some exurbs in Livingston and Oakland.  > Southern Michigan counties are quite rural and include blue collar small cities like Monroe, Jackson, Battle Creek, Adrian and Cold Water. This district shares economic interests and keeps most of these counties together.  > Southwestern Michigan communities are kept together in a district that connects the cities that dot the coastline from New Buffalo all the way up to Holland.  > Kent County is kept whole, and is united with culturally similar suburbs and cities such as Georgetown township and Grand Haven in Ottawa County for a clean and simple district  > Central and Mid-Michigan are kept together   > Northern Michigan and Upper Peninsula are kept together  "

162,plan,ush,"lower peninsula ,fed house lower peninsula,fed house west coast,five counties together","Federal House Lower Peninsula, W.Coast","The mission of the Leelanau Early Childhood Development Commission (LECDC.)  is to “provide families access to a high quality, comprehensive, accountable system of care and pre-school experience for children birth through age 5.”  The LECDC Board members are long term, and some life long, residents of Leelanau County. We are all active in our community and can say with certainty that we know the history, culture, economics and needs of our area.  We have a school superintendent, student support staff, a county commissioner, pre-school directors, early childhood specialists, entrepreneurs, small business owners, fruit farmers, a judge, members of our local family collaborative, members of our local chambers of commerce, members of our Latino and indigenous communities on our Board. Although our “home base” is Leelanau County, a peninsula hugged by the Grand Traverse Bay and Lake Michigan, our collaborating partners are in Grand Traverse, Benzie, Antrim, and Kalkaska Counties.  Much the same can be said of many organizations and businesses located in each of our five-counties.   We ask that our five counties be kept together as a “community of interest” as much as feasible in the current redistricting process.   We appreciate all five counties with approximately 172,000 residents could be in one state senate district, but have too great a population to be in one state house district, and too small a population to be the sole composition of a single federal district. However, we believe these five counties share cultural and historical characteristics and economic interests and should be considered a “community of interest” and kept together along their county boundaries as much as possible when drawing the new district lines.  Our five counties have common bonds and comprise a “community of interest” because we share services, a school district, resources, transportation and the identity as being the broader Grand Traverse Bay Area.  Specifically, LECDC is working on the expansion of affordable, quality child care across the region. All five-counties have inadequate child care to provide for our growing work force. This five-county area has recently been awarded responsibility for the management of the Tri-Share pilot program to address the scarcity of child care in our region.    Also consider the following common bonds. A significant number residents of all five counties: •	travel to Grand Traverse County for work; •	utilize the hospital, doctors and pediatricians located in Grand Traverse County;   Further, we share educational, social service, agricultural and tourism resources: •	Northwest Education Services is a five-county region of Antrim, Benzie, Grand Traverse, Leelanau and Kalkaska schools.   •	Northwestern Community College is the area’s post-high school institution. •	Many local service agencies cover all, if not several, of these counties.  (e.g. Child Advocacy Center, United Way of Northwest Michigan, Northwest Community Action Agency, Great Start Collaborative Traverse Bay, Women’s Resource Center, Area Agency on Aging of Northwest Michigan, Substance Free Coalition of NW Michigan) •	All five counties lack adequate, affordable housing and work in collaboration with each other on initiatives to address this concern. •	Our local circuit court jurisdiction is comprised of Grand Traverse, Leelanau and Antrim counties.   •	A public transportation system connects Leelanau with Grand Traverse Counties. Actually, the only land routes out of Leelanau County are through Grand Traverse or Benzie County.   •	The Traverse Area Regional Trail (TART) trail goes through Leelanau, Antrim and Grand Traverse Counties. •	These five-counties all rely on the financial rewards of northern Michigan tourism.  •	Leelanau and Benzie are the home of the Sleeping Bear National Park.  •	Grand Traverse, Leelanau, Antrim and Benzie counties share shoreline, sit at the basin of the Grand Traverse Bay and/or the shoreline of Lake Michigan.   •	Area water protection organizations interact in these shoreline counties.  •	Leelanau, Grand Traverse, Antrim and Benzie comprise the majority of commercial cherries grown in Michigan and 55% of Michigan wine grapes are grown in Leelanau and Grand Traverse Counties.   The broader lower northwest Michigan counties we have included in our state senate and federal house map proposals also share several bonds. Our counties are known for year round tourism: beaches in the summer, skiing in the winter and hunting, camping and the color tour in the fall. The counties that we have included in our map proposals are along main transportation arteries in the northern western Lower Peninsula, namely US 131 and 127. These counties host four major post-graduate institutions: Northwestern Michigan Community College, North Central Michigan College, Central Michigan College, and Kirtland College.    We are all Michiganders, but our five-county region shares so much in common, but not state house and state senate districts.  Currently, Leelanau, Grand Traverse, Antrim Kalkaska and Benzie counties are spread over four house districts (the 101st, 103rd, 104th and 106th) and two different senate districts (the 35th and 37th). Our current federal district is the vast geographic District 1 that encompasses 25,000 square miles, all of the 15 Upper Peninsula counties and 17 Lower Peninsula counties.  We are submitting suggestions for state house and state senate. We are also submitting two federal house suggestion: one in the Lower Peninsula and along the west side of the state and one encompassing the Upper Peninsula and along the east coast of the state. Again, we ask that our five counties, Leelanau, Grand Traverse, Benzie, Antrim, and Kalkaska be kept together as a “community of interest” as much as feasible in the current redistricting process.

This 6-5-2 (Democratic-Republican-tossup) composition is representative of the state’s partisan lean in recent years and includes 5 districts that would be somewhat or highly competitive under ordinary partisan conditions.  My major priorities included keeping every municipality, including the city of Detroit, entirely intact; minimizing county splits, with only 12 counties of 83 (~14%) being divided; keeping Kalamazoo and Battle Creek together; keeping the greater Lansing area together; keeping Flint, Saginaw, Bay City, and Midland together; and adhering to general principles of contiguity and compactness. Only one district, Detroit-Highland Park-Hamtramck, is majority-minority, but the map should withstand the scrutiny of the Voting Rights Act’s racially polarized voting regulations, as the metro Detroit districts and the Flint-Saginaw-Bay City district will usually elect candidates that are favored by their significant Black populations. "
165,plan,,,VRA 2 Majority-Minority Districts,"It is difficult to draw 2 majority-minority US House Districts of about 776,000 people.  I appreciate that this draft is based on the old data and so some shift may be required.   Note that only 1 of the two districts is majority-black but both a majority-minority.  One reason for this is that I did my best to keep the Latino population in SW Detroit intact.  I also tried to keep Detroit neighborhoods of similar character together.  If someone else wants to propose another map to swap some areas, I will not be offended.  It isn't easy, though.  Another possibility would be to connect one of the districts to Pontiac, Flint, and/or Saginaw with very thin strips of land (potentially partial voting precincts).  I don't favor that idea because it seems artificial, but I'm willing to listen."

Examples-the Inland Waterway starts at Lake Huron in Cheboygan County, and allows boaters to weave their way through rivers and lakes to arrive at Lake Michigan in Emmet County.  Another example-when tourists visit Mackinac City, they may sleep in Cheboygan County, eat in Emmet County, and visit Mackinac Island or St. Ignace in Mackinac County.

Having lived in these places I have a great respect for each of them, and their similarities and differences. Having lived in Hillsdale County for nearly 36 years I am very familiar with the area. I am an involved resident and have served my community on numerous boards and committees. In preparing a congressional map for my area I thought of the things that connected entire counties to make a compact district, though for population purposes I had to add western Washtenaw.  My map includes four border counties (Branch, Hillsdale, Lenawee, and Monroe) which have strong economic interests as border counties. They directly deal with the impacts of differing laws between Michigan, and southern neighbors, Ohio and Indiana. In addition our local paper reaches across these four counties. Hillsdale has a strong independent hospital, but the other three counties are all part of a large hospital system that shares resources.  Beyond these border county connections there are several economic and community interests that connect us north. The Region 2 Aging Agency and Region Plan Commission both cover Hillsdale, Lenawee, and Jackson counties. There are also strong tourism ties related to the Michigan International Speedway which is located where the three counties connect. We also have strong education ties between counties. Kellogg Community College has a satellite location in Branch County, Jackson College and Spring Arbor University have locations in Hillsdale.   Having lived in various locations around the state I have seen how people choose to live is very different across state. Where I live people choose to live in less densely populated areas in comparison to more densely populated metropolitan areas. The seven counties and western Washtenaw I have included in this map by in large have a low population density feel and way of life. "

The greater Grand Rapids area and Kent County are due their own appropriate congressional representation, and this conclusion is supported by population data."

But, our district was gerrymandered so that the townships that contain the cities and villages are in the 107th District.  The remainder of the townships are in the 106th District.  A district of counties that have nothing to do with how we utilize resources, or even where we usually have any reason to go.  I had to look on a map to find out where the other counties in my district were, because they are so completely unfamiliar.   This map reflects Cheboygan County's part of the Straits of Mackinac.  In fact, Mackinac City, at the south end of the Mackinac  Bridge is in both Cheboygan and Emmet county.  It makes sense to keep our counties together, along with Presque Isle and Mackinac County, as we are the counties most directly related by any direct activity from Line 5, and tourism.

We should be included with an area like Kentwood, communities that more reflect our urban interests. Please keep the more metropolitan areas together.  "
200,plan,house,"grand rapids city,east grand rapids city,kentwood city,diversity,metro,house,senate,kent county",State house: Keep metro GR together,"Thank you for the time and effort you are putting in to re-drawing our district lines to reflect our community more fairly and logically. I live on the southeast side of the City of Grand Rapids in a neighborhood called Eastown. I’ve lived in Eastown for almost 12 years. I was born and raised in the City of East Grand Rapids, moved away for school and returned 12 years ago. I have two children who are 10 and 7 years old. I practice immigration law and love that I live in such a diverse area of the state, where people feel welcome. That said, we very specific issues that affect our metro area more than others, like affordable housing and access to world class education for all of our kids.  My request is this: please keep metro Grand Rapids together. The map that I’m submitting shows that the city of Grand Rapids can easily be divided into two State House seats, capturing folks on the northside and southside.   Eastown borders several communities that have rich histories and connections to each other. For example, my children attended childcare at Baxter Community Center, which is located just a few blocks west of our house. Baxter is an incredibly diverse neighborhood and holds strong connections to the African American community. One of our favorite places to walk to go out to eat is the East Hills neighborhood, where we can enjoy both old and new restaurants and bars. My kids love to swim at the MLK park swimming pool in the Ottawa Hills neighborhood – again just blocks away. The kids have played soccer through the GR in Parks and Recreation league at McKay-Jaycees Park, which is on the southern-most border of the City of Grand Rapids. In short: our lives are here in southern Grand Rapids. It is imperative that we have a Representative who lives in south Grand Rapids so that they can better represent our unique interests, population, and needs.  When it comes to the Senate districts, it makes sense to keep the following three cities together, as they encompass the southern metro areas that seamlessly interact with each other: City of Grand Rapids, City of East Grand Rapids, and Kentwood. For example, my mom still lives in the same house where I grew up in East Grand Rapids. I love to take my boys to my mom’s house to visit. It takes us less than 10 minutes to ride our bikes from our house to hers. It’s about 4 minutes by car. The lines between GR and EGR are barely discernable and we feel as much a part of my mom’s street as we do our own, just a mile or so away. When can't buy something locally, we do our shopping primarily in Kentwood. It's close and convenient to us who live on the southside of Grand Rapids.  Thank you for ensuring that we have more fair and equitable representation in Lansing and DC."

Historically, Saginaw, Midland and Bay City have been known as the Tri-cities. Three communities working together, pooling resources for mutual benefit has and should continue to be our moniker.   In the content below you will find that these communities share a mutual benefit of being enveloped into one state senate district. These three communities share a community college (Delta College), a regional-tri-city airport (MBS) and of paramount importance, these communities share vital water infrastructure that serves the needs of the citizens and thousands of local and large businesses (SMMWSC).  Our community will cite the historic, cultural, and the economic impact that we all share from these anchor institutions.   Michigan’s 32nd senate district should include Bay City, the City of Midland and the City of Saginaw for because they hold numerous vital communities of interest:   Delta College Serving Saginaw, Midland and Bay City  Content provided by Delta.edu -Educational Community of Interest   Through the collaboration and innovation of 300 civic-minded individuals who saw the need  for a top-quality community college in mid-Michigan, Delta College was created to serve Bay, Midland and Saginaw counties. Delta College opened in 1961 with 2,600 students, and now enrolls about 9,000 annually. Students range from high school students taking dual-enrollment classes to older adults returning to college to enhance their skills. Today, Delta continues to value collaboration and innovation as we lead the way in community college education. From our involvement as a founding member in the League for Innovation in the Community College to our commitment to Achieving the Dream as a Leader College, Delta College continues to learn and grow as we encourage our students to do the same. The main campus has been expanded and renovated a number of times throughout the years as we continue to offer students the best learning equipment and technology available. And to provide more convenience, Delta College has established three centers in Bay City, Midland and Saginaw.        MBS Airport – (Midland, Bay City and Saginaw)  Content provided from MBSAIRPORT.ORG       Economic and Historic Community of Interest In the 1930s, a plan to develop an airport to serve the Saginaw Valley and surrounding communities led to the development of Tri-City International Airport, known since 1994 as MBS International Airport. In 1941, a square mile of property was purchased by the cities of Midland and Saginaw and Bay County, in order to build an airport large enough to meet the anticipated needs of the area. However, our country was at war, and wartime needs took precedence. National leaders feared that Detroit Airport, where combat aircraft were being built, could be a target for bombing. As a result, the federal government took over MBS International Airport and added more land, runways and taxiways so that fighter aircraft could be stationed there, if needed, to intercept bombers en route to Detroit. The airport infrastructure benefited significantly from this early infusion of federal dollars. And although MBS International Airport was never needed as an alternative World War II airfield base, it was used for a time as a Prisoner of War Camp, housing thousands of Hitler’s troops. On September 19, 1943, Brig. Gen. Hoyt S. vandenBerg, who was deputy chief of staff of the U.S. Army Air Corps, dedicated the airport before one of the largest audiences in Tri-City history. On June 1, 1946, the airport commission resumed full responsibility of MBS on behalf of the three owning communities, and the airport was opened to commercial aircraft.  In 2005, The Boyd Group International, Inc., an aviation research, forecasting and consulting firm based in Evergreen, Colorado, studied MBS International Airport’s economic impact on the area. The airport’s economic benefit to Midland, Bay and Saginaw counties was estimated to be more than $100 million annually. The direct impact of jobs and property-related revenues was estimated at more than $50 million annually. The report also calculated the savings in time and cost to local users of MBS versus other airports at more than $7 million annually.  The full economic impact study can be found at: http://www.mbsairport.org/pdfs/economic_impact_study.pdf  City of Saginaw & City of Midland Water Cooperative   Economic, Historic, and Cultural Community of interest  Content provided by the City of Midland’s website: Saginaw-Midland Municipal Water Supply Corporation “The Saginaw-Midland Municipal Water Supply Corporation (SMMWSC), organized in 1946, operates under Act 233 of Michigan Public Acts of 1955, as a non-profit municipal corporation providing raw Lake Huron water to its owners, the cities of Saginaw and Midland. The corporation is a Michigan Type 1 Public Water Supply and operates within the rules and regulations of Michigan's Safe Drinking Water Act 399 P.A. 1976, as amended. The corporation provides limited treatment and basic disinfection of Lake Huron water before it is transmitted to households, businesses and industry. This high-quality, reliable raw water service has been provided to customers in mid-Michigan for more than 50 years.” Content provided by the City of Saginaw’s website: The City of Saginaw owns and operates a world class water system. This system has been in existence for more than 90 years. Originally the source was the Saginaw River. However, in 1946, understanding the need for an abundant, consistently high quality raw water source, Saginaw in partnership with the City of Midland formed the Saginaw Midland Municipal Water Supply Corporation (SMMWSC). SMMWSC chose Whitestone Point as the location to build an intake into Lake Huron. Whitestone Point is located 8 miles North of AuGres, approximately 65 miles from each city. The original system design was for a maximum pumping capacity of 43 million gallons per day (MGD) of which Saginaw would receive 23 million and Midland 20 million. The total cost of the original project was $10.3 million dollars. Over the course of the last 70 years many upgrades have been made to the system. The present day design has a maximum capacity of 115 MGD with an estimated cost to duplicate of $430 million dollars. Because of the foresight of the leaders of both cities, Saginaw and Midland benefit from having one of the best raw water sources in the world. The Great Lakes contain one fifth of the world's fresh water supply. This great source water is pumped daily to both Cities where treatment is provided to produce potable water. Potable water is water that does not contain objectionable pollution, contamination, minerals or infective agents and is considered safe for human consumption.  As you can see, this relationship between the Cities of both Saginaw and Midland has not only historic relevance but also economic benefit. In the fight for resources federally and in Michigan, these communities must be joined together for a fair opportunity for funding and capital infrastructure improvements.

204,plan,ush,, Asian American Community/Hamtramck COI,"My community of interest is the Asian American community of Hamtramck MI.  I grew up in Hamtramck and it’s home to many Bangladeshi Americans; it has a high concentration of Asian Americans and many other immigrant communities representing about 35% of the population. In recent years Asian Americans in Hamtramck have expanded into Detroit due to the high cost of housing, and limited access to affordable housing as the population has grown. I am asking that we include parts of Detroit in Hamtramck’s district.   One example of why the commission should include parts of Detroit with Hamtramck is the ability to service immigrant communities with better language access materials in native languages. There is a large demand for civic, health, and educational reading material in native languages, given the recent health crisis of the covid-19 pandemic, it has highlighted and uncovered the need for more language access throughout Hamtramck and parts of Detroit. Although my organization focuses on civic engagement in the last year we have worked in the community translating critical health information because this was not available through state or local government agencies.   This is just one example of resource needs that my community experiences on a daily basis.  The AAPI community trusts that you will hear our needs and consider them when you redraw the maps. We ask, as a community, that Hamtramck should be connected with Detroit's district.  Not doing so would be to the exclusion of the Asian American voices in Detroit and Hamtramck . I have submitted a map on the portal for your reference. I thank you for listening to me. "

209,plan,ush,,Common Sense Congressional Map,"This map is designed to keep communities of interest together while still respecting county and municipal boundaries. Additionally, the map seeks to be as compact as possible while still creating two majority African-American districts in metro detroit. Finally, the map maintains partisan balance with an element of competitiveness, as Democrats and Republicans can count on four districts each with five districts ""up for grabs"" in any given election cycle allowing for greater responsiveness. Population is equal as of 2019 ACS estimates, and more detail is provided at this link to a DRA map with minimal block level changes. https://davesredistricting.org/join/e5c0bb6e-2742-4d45-8af1-bfdd80f7e991.  The above map shows that you can create common sense, nice looking districts that are still fair to parties, demographic groups, and most importantly, individual citizens. Highlights include a northern Michigan 1st district with no county breaks, a Grand Rapids based 3rd district which combines Kent County with GR's closest suburbs in Ottawa County, a 7th district that binds together Flint and the Tri-Cities, and last but not least, a 5th district that finally unites the Lansing area. Metro Detroit is always tricky, but there are two clean majority Black districts to start from, an Ann Arbor district with that includes the similar communities of Livonia, Plymouth, Canton, and Northville and doesn't split Downriver, an inner ring northern suburban district, and an Oakland/Livingston suburban/exurban district that will be one of the top swing districts in America.

210,plan,,,Compact Congressional District Plan,Redistricting should abide by the following guidelines. In order of priority: 1.	No more than a one percent population deviation between districts in each state. The split between districts should make the faster growing districts the lower population side of the split. (The faster growing districts will grow toward equality.) 2.	All districts must be geographically compact. 3.	Minimize the splitting of political subdivisions. No more than one municipality should be split in a district. 4.	Minimize the splitting of school districts. 5.	Minimize the change from previous district boundaries. 6.	Minimize the number of media markets in the districts. 7.	Natural geographical features and barriers should be respected.  This program could not account for most of these criteria. This map is a simple example of compact districts. Compact as far as possible given the need to closely balance district populations. I tried to minimize the division of counties and cities. But I am not from MI and did not take the time to research the actual boundaries. I used the lines given on the map. I did not take race or party affiliation into consideration.  Redistricting should be neutral so that citizens are picking their representatives instead of politicians or interest groups picking their voters.

Instead Van Buren County should be included in the district as it was prior to the 2010 Gerrymander. St. Joseph County is different economically and culturally than the tri-county southwest Michigan area. The border between Cass and Van Buren is blurry, with many communities overlapping. On the Berrien side, South Haven and St. Joseph are similar tourism focused economies and the border cities of Watervliet and Hartford are very similar with much overlap between the two.

I also see that friends in Chelsea, for example, don’t have the same access to services we need as we age, from broadband to accessible transportation. A dear friend, on a fixed income, still working as a church organist at 75, is paying three times what I pay for broadband, and has no access to public transport. These services are perhaps best managed at the county level, but our County government can only work as well as it’s permitted by the state and even the federal government. We need representation that recognizes the value of fair and well-run public services.   I’m also a volunteer working to ensure equitable access to vital services, including Covid-related services- testing, vaccination, and resources, in the eastern part of the county (Ypsilanti, Ypsi Township and Superior Township). Minority communities there are often overlooked, and while they are small, they constitute a community of interest that deserves to be represented in an inclusive manner.   For these reasons I’m hoping to see a US House district that includes the entire county and that reaches out to include the western reaches. We share recreational resources, and many folks commute along I-95 as far as Jackson. I also work with groups as far over as Battle Creek.  I feel that an urban/rural alliance will be of benefit to all, and reduce the alarming state of polarization we are now seeing. We should be talking to each other more!

I’ve had the occasion to teach music and to substitute teach in Dexter, Chelsea, and Saline, and to do musical presentations in Jackson schools, and I feel strongly that we have a common interest in having equitable access to education– to funds and budgets, but also to cultural enrichment opportunities.   I also see that friends in Chelsea, for example, don’t have the same access to services we need as we age, from broadband to accessible transportation. A dear friend, on a fixed income, still working as a church organist at 75, is paying three times what I pay for broadband, and has no access to public transport. These services are perhaps best managed at the county level, but our County government can only work as well as it’s permitted by the state and even the federal government. We need representation that recognizes the value of fair and well-run public services.   I’m also a volunteer working to ensure equitable access to vital services, including Covid-related services- testing, vaccination, and resources, in the eastern part of the county (Ypsilanti, Ypsi Township and Superior Township). Minority communities there are often overlooked, and while they are small, they constitute a community of interest that deserves to be represented in an inclusive manner.   For these reasons I’m hoping to see a US House district that includes the entire county and that reaches out to include the western reaches. We share recreational resources, and many folks commute along I-95 as far as Jackson. I also work with groups as far over as Battle Creek.  I feel that an urban/rural alliance will be of benefit to all, and reduce the alarming state of polarization we are now seeing. We should be talking to each other more! And belonging to the same District could help to make that happen. Here's one possibility: https://districtr.org/plan/26798  I think it would also make sense for the county to include two State Senate districts to be oriented around the same axis, uniting Washtenaw County around the central “engine” of Ann Arbor/Ypsilanti, and including Dexter and Saline on one side, Chelsea and Jacksonn on the other. Our community commutes readily among all these towns, and commerce flows among them as well. I easily go to parks in all of this area, and friends easily come to Ann Arbor for medical or other services, and for recreation as well. We should be together. One possible configuration:  https://districtr.org/plan/26786    "

243,plan,ush,,Global Detroit Community of Interest Map,"This is a Community of Interest Map created in Districtr as a District Map for the purpose of illustrating the exact precincts it contains.  This map and narrative of the Hamtramck-Banglatown Community of Interest was built out by Global Detroit, a community and economic development organization, with community feedback.   Since the arrival of German farmers in the 1800s, Hamtramck has been known as a magnet for immigrant groups. The Polish autoworkers of the 1900s are perhaps the most well known group, but today the predominant groups are Bangladeshi and Yemeni. While limitations of ethnic representation in Census data hinder the accuracy of population numbers, we estimate that of the current Hamtramck population of roughly 22,000, there are a little over 9,000 foreign born residents. Of that number, roughly 3,800 are from Bangladesh and 3,650 from Yemen. This does not reflect second and third generation residents of Bangladeshi and Yemeni heritage and we also know that with expansion into Detroit, the numbers of the whole community are much larger. There is also still a significant number of Eastern European residents and a little over a third of the community’s residents are Black. This has created a distinct multiethnic, multilinguistic, multicultural community as evidenced by the diversity of restaurants, grocery stores, and other small businesses that line Hamtramck’s streets.   While residents of this community contribute economically to the wider region by staffing manufacturing, hospitality, and other frontline jobs, a large portion are living below the poverty line and rely on income-qualified programming and assistance. Simultaneously, this Community of Interest has a significantly larger density of locally owned businesses than the Detroit area as a whole.   Environmentally, residents of this Community of Interest face public health challenges due to the industrial use of land in the South and East of the community. This industrial land use has created a Sacrifice Zone which has led to chronic respiratory diseases, lower birth weights, and higher mortality rates both in general and throughout the COVID crisis, than in the rest of Michigan. Submission c780 builds out the environmental case for this Community of Interest more thoroughly.   While new residents are drawn to this area because of the cultural communities established in Hamtramck, housing stock is dwindling in quantity, quality, and affordability which has necessitated that the community branch out into local Detroit neighborhoods which have more vacant properties. The neighborhood of Banglatown, so named for the large concentration of Bangladeshi residents, is an example of this. It straddles the Hamtramck/Detroit border to the north. The Bangladeshi community will continue to grow northwards and likely form a corridor between Hamtramck and Warren where a significant number of Bangladeshis currently reside over the next decade or so. Yemeni residents are mostly expanding into Detroit to the South East towards 94 and Gratiot, but are also moving in smaller numbers into East Davison Village which borders Banglatown.   The community is also expanding westward towards John R, drawn by businesses and organizations that they rely on - the Wayne State University Islamic Center of Detroit on Cass, the all-girls Detroit International Academy which has a significant number of Bangladeshi students, and the Secretary of State office on Grand Boulevard - as well as new projects in development off Brush, Holbrook, and Owen.    This trend of outward expansion will continue. Since the Commission is tasked with being mindful of city, township, and county boundaries when drawing district maps, it is vital to emphasize that using the Hamtramck/Detroit borders as guides for district boundaries, as several proposed maps suggest, would sever this Community of Interest and be incredibly harmful to its political power.

244,plan,senate,"ottawa,muskegon,holland,oceana","State Senate: Oceana, Muskegon, Ottawa","After hearing some of the testimony at the June 29 hearing in Muskegon, I developed a map of two potential Senate districts in West Michigan based on the 2019 estimated population counts from the U.S. Census Bureau. The northern district includes all of Muskegon and Oceana counties, plus four jurisdictions in Ottawa County: the cities of Ferrysburg and Grand Haven, pls the townships of Grand Haven and Spring Lake. The southern district includes the rest of Ottawa County plus all of Holland (which is split between Allegan and Ottawa counties).   These districts are relatively compact and meet constitutional requirements relating to contiguity and consideration of city and township boundaries. The northern district is competitive, having been won by both former President Trump and Governor Whitmer in recent elections. The southern district is less competitive, since it comprises most of Ottawa County (which for years has been one of the most Republican counties in the entire country)."

246,plan,senate,,Tim's Wayne Co. State Senate Districts,"My wife and I raised our family in homes located in Livonia and Redford Twp. I believe these two communities comprise a Community of Interest. Reading local news, I often see that police and fire units help out in these adjacent communities.  These communities share major shopping areas  along Plymouth Road, I-96 and 7 Mile Road. Livonia businesses draw employees from nearby Redford Twp. The Senior Alliance is the Area Agency on Aging  serving the western and downriver areas of Wayne County, including Redford Twp. A different Area Agency on Aging serves Detroit.  Mental health service agencies Lincoln Behavioral and Hegira serve these and the other communities in western Wayne county.  Telegraph Road is a natural boundary between Detroit and the suburbs of western Wayne County.  For some reason people often think Redford Twp is a neighborhood area of Detroit, like Old Redford or Brightmore, but that is not true. Redford Twp. belongs with Livonia in a State Senate District. I drew 7 Wayne County Senate districts.  I gave great consideration to school district boundaries; for instance I included the northern section of Westland that is part of the Livonia School District in District 5 with Livonia.  I tried to keep municipalities whole and I took care to include Dearborn and Dearborn Heights in the same district based on citizen testimony at the town hall held in Dearborn.  I drew three districts within Detroit's border.  My focus there was simply to produce comparable population numbers.  I am sure there are many problems with those particular boundary lines.  This is a challenging task, and I am so appreciative of the Citizen Commission's service to our state!  "

Many Kentwood residents either work or do errands in either southern Grand Rapids or in Gaines Township, and vice versa. For example, many residents shop at Family Fare in Gaines Township or at Meijer at either 28th and Kalamazoo or 68th and Kalamazoo. My dad and I (who live in Kentwood) often go to both the Kentwood and Gaines Township branches of the Kent District Library.   In addition, parts of southern Grand Rapids and northern Gaines Township are in the Kentwood Public Schools district, one of the most diverse districts in Michigan. Located in Gaines Township, East Kentwood High School was recently named the most diverse high school in all of Michigan, with students from dozens of countries who speak dozens of languages!  Put simply, we have much more in common with these areas than we do with northeastern Allegan County (with which we currently share a House District) or most other suburban jurisdictions (such as the more affluent and less diverse East Grand Rapids or Grand Rapids Township)."

257,plan,house,,Keep School Districts in Mind,"When I think about ""communites of interest,"" my mind immediately goes to school districts. People within the same school district naturally share similar interests and pride of place. I would urge you to keep school districts together as much as you can. Neighboring school districts with historic  rivalries often share the types of cultural ties people might look for when drawing voting districts. People in these neighboring school districts have a reason to see each other and they know each other well. I am not an expert on the entire state but I am fairly familiar with some of these cross-community bonds in the Grand Rapids area. With that in mind, I've mapped out 14 districts for the state house that I feel would go fairly well together.   I will explain my map district-by-district starting in the northwest corner. District 1 (light pink) - This is a rural district. Shelby, Montague, Whitehall, Oakridge and Ravenna share close bonds with each other. Hesperia, Fremont, Holton, Grant, and Kent City share similar bonds. District 2 (lavender) - This is also a rural district. These school districts are all in the same conference and know each other well. District 3 (light lime) - This is an urban/suburban district representing a fairly tight-knit community in Muskegon County. District 4 (gold) - This is a lakeshore tourist town district. Grand Haven, Ferrysburg, and Spring Lake are known as the ""tri-cities"" and should be kept together. Spring Lake and Fruitport have close community ties. I feel Norton Shores has more community ties with District 3 (light lime), specifically Muskegon, but I couldn't figure out a way to make it work population wise and I thought that Norton Shores had enough ties with Grand Haven that this was an acceptable compromise. District 5 (light blue) - This is another lakeshore tourist district making up the City of Holland and its neighbors to the north in Holland and Park Townships (West Ottawa schools). To the south, Holland shares cultural ties with Saugatuck and Douglas. Saugatuck Schools share ties with nearby Fennville and could be put with them instead. District 6 (orange) - This district is the most narrow of the ones I've prepared, but these are all farming communities with close ties. Coopersville and Allendale are close. Allendale and Zeeland are close. Zeeland and Hamilton are close. Coopersville, Hamilton, and Allendale schools are all in the same conference. District 7 (teal) - This is what I call the ""West Side"" district. I define the west side of Grand Rapids as anything west of the Grand River. The West Side is arguably the proudest, most tight-knit part of the city. It shares close ties with the City of Walker (represented by the Kenowa Hills school district) and Comstock Park. Comstock Park and Sparta's school districts share close ties. District 8 (purple) - This is a suburban district. Grandville, Jenison, and Hudsonville schools all share close ties. District 9 (yellow) - This is an urban district which includes the large and tight-knit Creston neighborhood extending all the way down to the southeast part of the city. District 10 (magenta) - This district is mostly the City of Wyoming. Godwin Heights and Kelloggsville schools share close ties and should be together. District 11 (dark lime) - This distict is mostly the City of Kentwood mixed with some of the southeast side of Grand Rapids. These two areas share close cultural ties. District 12 (cyan) - This is a mostly rural district with the most populated area being Caledonia. Caledonia shares cultural ties with Middleville and Byron Center. Middleville schools share ties with Wayland. District 13 (blue) - This district is a mix of suburban and rural. East Grand Rapids shares close ties with the Forest Hills area. Forest Hills shares ties with Lowell. Northview schools share ties with both East Grand Rapids and Forest Hills schools. However, I could also see East Grand Rapids pairing nicely with the southeast side of Grand Rapids. I could see Northview schools pairing nicely with either the northeast side of Grand Rapids or Rockford. District 14 (periwinkle) - This is a mostly rural district made up of Rockford, Cedar Springs, Greenville and Belding school districts. As mentioned before, Rockford would also pair nicely with the Northview school district, as they share the rather large Plainfield Township."

I think that if we stop trying to juggle people around to make sure they either have to or don't have to deal with ""those people"" and just make it random, we'll find the results aren't what people expect. Maybe these aren't the best squares, but I hope it captures my general idea. Pairing people more randomly should also ensure more perspectives."

This map would remove its gerrymandered split and group it with the communities along the I-96 Highway/Grand River corridor to the lakeshore.  The only split city is Detroit for population reasons although I tried to keep its split sections as whole and compact as possible.

Among people at least five years old living in Hamtramck city, Michigan, 69.4% spoke a language other than English at home. Hamtramck is unique in being the most diverse municipality in Michigan in terms of residents’ national origin. We urge the commission to consider the shared experiences between the immigrant communities in Hamtramck and Detroit. We echo the statements made by APIA that keeping these COIs together will help immigrant-based organizations provide culturally appropriate services and enhance the ability to serve immigrant communities with better language access materials in native languages.

283,plan,house,"kent,grand rapids city,wyoming city,east grand rapids city,kentwood city,grandville city,walker",Kent County State House Districts,"Though I wasn’t able to make the input session in Grand Rapids, I really like drawing maps and working with data. I recently listened to the meeting, took some notes, and I think I have a solution for the state house in Kent County.   Here’s what I have with respect to Kent County and state house district lines.  A lot of people made general arguments to try to keep state house districts within county lines. Specifically for Kent, I counted 7 people: 9, 10, 18, 83, 100, 102, 107. So, I tried to do that.   19 people made general arguments that land use and residential life-styles should be considered when building communities of interest and districts. This was usually said as, “keep cities together,” “keep cities with cities and townships with townships,” or “keep rural, rural.” The arguments were because these are different forms of local government and have different issues where legislators could focus. Speakers 2, 7, 13, 14, 15, 24, 30, 42, 53, 55, 66, 67, 68, 71, 79, 83, 99, 107, and 111 all said something in favor of building mostly city or mostly township districts.   15 people noted that the Metro 6 Cities should be kept together as much as possible because of their shared services (transit, garbage, recycling, water), their composition as the economic core of the GR metro area, and their same system of government. Speakers 13, 14, 15, 24, 28, 32, 40, 53, 55, 61, 78, 83, 98, 99, and 108 all asked that the Metro 6 be combined to form state house districts. I kept these general principles in mind as I drew the districts.   As far as specific districts, I heard the following.   1-2. Based on population, I believe Grand Rapids will include two full state house districts and a few thousand people left over. Speakers 1, 14, 19, 36, 39, 48, 57, and online #2 argued that the city should be divided to create a northern district and a southern district. They didn’t all put the geography with together with a community of interest, but several speakers asked that a state house district be drawn to give under-represented people (minorities, people of color) a chance to have a representative from their community. Speakers 1, 23, 54, 57, 61, 62, and online #2 argued for creating a Grand Rapids district with the most possible POC people in it. Most of the Black, Hispanic and Asian population in Grand Rapids lives south of Wealthy Street so I think this is why people were suggesting a north-south split with the 49507 zip code forming the core of the district. Many argued for keeping Grand Rapids as whole as possible, because of the shared services, economy, and government of Grand Rapids. I was able to draw two districts entirely within Grand Rapids with a north-south split and a few precincts left over. The northern district would be composed of the Westside, most of Ward 2, and downtown GR, including medical hill.   3. 10 speakers made a case for a Wyoming & Grandville state house district. They made economic, shared public school district, shared fire and water, both in Metro 6 cities, and other arguments. I found they were right that the population matches right up. Speakers 1, 9, 14, 15, 19, 21, 36, 71, 99, and 100 asked for a Wyoming & Grandville district. Within this, 3 speakers asked to not split Wyoming up into multiple state house districts (15, 28, and 71). It was easy to draw this district.  4. 11 people asked for a district composed of some combination of Kentwood, East Grand Rapids, the parts of Grand Rapids that boarders those two cities, and Grand Rapids Township. They made a Metro 6 City argument along with a shared economy and the desire to not be lumped in with rural and semi-rural townships. Speakers 2, 7, 13, 18, 24, 32, 39, 44, 54, 81, and 113 all asked for a district composed of Kentwood and East Grand Rapids along with whatever parts of GR city and GR Township are necessary to reach a population threshold. I drew a district with Kentwood, the remaining few precincts in Grand Rapids that were left over (I picked the areas that are the homes of Calvin College and Aquinas College, because a state rep who represented this district would then look out for the interests of private, parochial colleges), East Grand Rapids, and Grand Rapids Township.  5. 4 people, asked for a state house district composed of the southern and southeastern townships in Kent County. Those are the formerly rural, and now partly exurban residential and partly agricultural (they were referred to as “semi-rural” townships by the Byron Township Supervisor). These are Byron Center, Gaines, Caledonia, Cascade and Lowell. To fill out the rest of the district and state within Kent County, I added very rural Bowne township. Speakers 10, 30, 53, and 63 made this argument. This district barely made the population threshold. I think if you had to, you’d make a break and add the southern few precincts in Ada which are the residential exurban parts around Ada village. That left me with the northwest and northeast sections of Kent County that were not mentioned during the townhall. I put them together in a way I thought made sense.   6. Walker (the orphaned metro 6 city that couldn’t fit with the others), Alpine township, Plainfield, Cannon township, Rockford city, and I had to add the precinct in Algoma township that borders Rockford city to get the population right. This district is a semi-rural, though it is anchored by two cities (Walker and Rockford) and the largest township in the county (Plainfield). It’s different from District 5 in that it’s more working-class as opposed to white collar.   7. This district is composed of the mostly agricultural townships in Kent. It starts with the northern townships before looping east and back into Ada. This one is really underpopulated, so you might have to get some neighboring townships in Muskegon, Ionia or Montcalm county. Or, it might have been an area of a lot of growth in the census.   I think these lines work. This proposed map doesn’t break up very many cities or townships. You’ll have to make some slight modifications when you get the final census numbers, but these are districts that could largely build a state house map for Kent County that is based on the townhall testimony."
284,plan,senate,"tri-cities,bay city,saginaw,midland",Tri-Cities Senate District,"Hello again commissioners, based on many recent comments from people within my area talking about how they want a State Senate district that included Bay City, Saginaw, and Midland, so I created just that. Within this plan, it connects the Tri-Cities into one state Senate district in which it includes the main cities, Bay City, Saginaw and Midland, as well as the other cities and towns of Auburn, Freeland, Shields, Buena Vista city, Essexville , Zilwaukee, and Carrollton. I feel that this district is good since these areas have much in common based on the many comments that people have been recently stating within their posts. Politically, the area is very competitive, in which in the 2016 Presidential Election went Republican by 47.25% compared to Democrats 47.17%. In the 2018 Gubernatorial Election the district went to Democrats by 52.91% compared to Republicans 44.38%. Lastly, in the 2020 Presidential Election it went to Democrats by 50.91% compared to Republicans 47.47%. This shows leaves to a situation in which the Tri-Cities can have good representation since its not partisanly controlled and allows for the different cities to be able to have a common goal that they all want to achieve. I hope you take this plan into some consideration since this seems to be a popular opinion to some people within Midland and possibly to Bay City and Saginaw as well. Thank you."

288,plan,ush,"universities,compact,contiguous ,urbanareas,urbancenters",13 contiguous and compact districts,"I wanted to see how hard it was to draw 13 contiguous, compact districts with two majority minority districts. It wasn't hard.  I first drew two districts in detroit, splitting around Woodward, for an East and West Detroit district and I made them the same size and with majority minority populations. From there it was a prioirty to me that county boundaries and district boundaries be the same, as much as possible. It helps people to be able to advocate for themselves if they have representation that covers the same area of the state. Third, I felt it was important for cities, which have the main population, be at the center. Not only do most people live in the cities but places like Ann Arbor have workers from the outlying suburbs, towns, and villages. These workers should be represented by the same representative where they work. This sometimes overruled the county rule because I was surpirsed by how many county lines bisect the suburbs from the city. If a city didn't have quite enough for a district, I added land within county boundaries, to make the population. In one case a couple of cities are close and have similar interests. This was Battle Creek and Kalamazoo. I also added Jackson because they are all cities that have manufacturing without as much tech and education as Ann Arbor or Lansing. I felt that tech and manufacturing shouls be kept together so that the representative can argue for their interests. I struggled a bit around Flint, Sagniaw and Bay City. Similar to Battle Creek, Kalamazoo and Jackson, they are manufacturing cities and people commute from one to the other. However they are too big to be one district so I was hard to divide them. Flint has a fairly large suburban sprawl around it. Adding the suburbs made Flint a district itself and then some of the low population areas in the thumb. I placed sagniaw with Lansing together because Lansing was the closest urban area with similar interests, without going over the limit. Last I felt there were certain low population areas,  that are communities of interest. I made the west side of the state one district because that area survives on tourism and the water. I added a Bay City to the farming and thumb area. This allows for the center of the state to be represented and for there to be an argricultural area.  It took me about an hour! It was also fun! "

290,plan,senate,,Tri-Counties for State Senate District,"I am submitting this Community of Interest Map as a State Senate District.  Saginaw, Bay City and Midland are called the Tri-Cities. All three cities are urban/suburban communities with similar history, economy, industry, and environmental interests.  Twenty years ago, Bay County was gerrymandered away from the Tri-County region in terms of state representation. Bay County was joined with Tuscola and Lapeer County to form a state senate district that has been represented by family farmers. As a result, Bay County has little representation of our more urban/suburban concerns as well as environmental concerns. Both Bay City and Saginaw grew up along the banks of the Saginaw River. Ours is a COmmunity that is on the Northern edge of an Industrial Corridor. We share concerns over water quality resulting from heavy manufacturing, the lumber business which opened up this are of the country in the 1800's. The Saginaw RIver is still an important shipping route and one of michigan's only navigable inland rivers. It is wide enough and deep enough for 800 foot freighters to reach the stone docks of Zilwaukee. In Bay County the river is spanned by 4 bascule drawbridges connecting the east and west sides of Bay City.  While industry and boaters rely on river access, the City of Bay City is responsible for the bridges' upkeep and has struggled to maintain them.  This is a tri county concern because movement from one side of the river to the other is necessary for all who live in this area.  Services that were once available in each community are now shared, which requires additional travel and/or commuting.  Goods that are transported to any community do so on roads leading directly from Bay City into Saginaw and Midland, such as I-75, I 10, M-84, The river Road (M-13), and M-47.  Health services are shared among the Atri-Cities. McLaren Bay Region for example, has more than 5000 employees living throughout the Bay Region. Patients move between Bay CIty, Saginaw and Midland for shared services and treatments. In adddition, the Tri-COunties share two important higher education Institutions. Students from each of the Tri-cities and tri-counties call Delta COllege and Saginaw Valley State University home.  There are many reasons to consider the tri-cities, tri-counties a Community . In fact, intercounty commuting was so prevalent that Bay and Saginaw COuntieswere designated by the U.S. Census Bureau as a single Metropolitan Statistical Area in the 1980's. Please allow us to have the state representation that we desire and deserve my allowing our voting disrict for state senate to be drawn as I have shown in the submitted map. Thank you very much for your attention on this.   Note: Since the maps on DIstrictR are being formed using 2010 Census data, I allowed the population number to be larger than what is needed for a state Senate district. When the new Census data is out, I think the numbers will be close to what is needed."

To that end, we want to be seen as a relevant voting area or a contested district. We want our COI to have their interests protected. It is imperative that our community of interests are inclusive of the ALICE population (Asset Limited Income Constrained), as well as folks in our communities that have been unemployed. Our community of interest should reflect the areas where the ESSER funds, as well as the ARPA funds, are most needed.  Our target goal is a population of around 90,000, which represents where people worship, work, reside and attend school. Our map also engages areas with high unemployment rates so that representatives can focus on job creation.   And lastly, we want to focus on areas where folks are clearly not getting their resources met (Jobs, Roads, Investment in education, Clean water, Health)."

295,plan,house,kent,An idea for a new and fair plan - map,"My name is James Thrall. I spent 41 years in the Field of Education - a coach, high school teacher, and principal plus 27 years as a school superintendent. I also served as an adjunct professor at GVSU. During my time as a superintendent I also served as a Local Rotary President and the Assistant Governor for the International Rotary for Southwest Michigan. During my tenure I witnessed how school districts suffered financially because the district lines were drawn up for monetary reasons. I want to thank you for finally drawing up a new and fair voting districts based on the 7 criteria you have listed rather than boundaries drawn for political aspirations. Given your criteria concerning population equality, geographical contiguousness, city boundaries and communities of interest I have a recommendation. The first house I bought was in Wyoming Michigan. I now live in Grandville Michigan. The congregation of my church is made up of individuals of both these cities. Children living in Wyoming attend Grandville schools. Children in Grandville attend Wyoming schools. Members of the service clubs and local organizations come from both cities. Rivertown Mall, a large shopping mall, is located near the boundary line for both cities. Both communities work together on many services. My recommendation is this - seeing that both are so close to the criteria you listed and the fact that their population together meets the criteria for a voting district - these two cities become one voting district. One other concern - Kent County has the population criteria for 7 districts. There should be no need to cross county lines for voting districts. The County already shares many services (Kent Intermediate School District, Sheriff, Library, etc.) and it seems logical to keep their voting districts contiguous with the county borders. Again THANK YOU for your time and effort in this momentous task. Thank you for listening and I will keep you in my prayers because you may need them."
296,plan,ush,,Tri-Counties/Flint/Genesee Confgressiona,"This map keeps the Tri-Cities (Bay City, Midland and Saginaw) together with Flint/Genesee in a Congressional District. There are numerous reasons to hold this region together in a Congressional District.  Historically these cities emerged in similar fashion.  Together they comprise an industrial corridor that is served by I-75, and the Saginaw, Tittabawasee, SHiawasee, and Flint Rivers. With the decline in domestic manufacturing all of the above communities have experienced reduced revenue to sustain the roads, bridges, and shipping channels of the rivers.   Health and social services are heavily relied on by an aging population. Services that were once present in each community are now shared and coordinated among these cities and townships. So for particular treatments and services, clients will travel to one or the other of the Tri-Cities, as well as to Flint. McLaren Bay Region in Bay City employees more than 5000 people. It is the largest employer in Bay City and is a subsidiary of McLaren Health Care Corp. in Flint.    The Tri-Cities are connected to Flint via the natural waterways. Specifically, the Shiawassee, Tittabawasee, Cass, FLint Rivers are all upstream tributaries of the SAGINAW RIVER. The Greenpoint of the Saginaw RIver is at the junciton of the Shiawassee and Saginaw Rivers. The elevation change from greenpoint all the way to the Bay is 2 feet elevation. That together with the shape, shallowness, wind, etc. will flood the Shiawassee RIver Flats as well as communities along the Saginaw river. While once quarter of the counties in the lower peninsula (22) are in the Saginaw Bay Watershed, it is the counties directly located on Saginaw River and sometimes the Bay that experience flooding. In 1986 that flooding extended all the way back to St. Charles and even Clare. The sewer systems of the watershed communities are the biggest tributaries into Saginaw River/Bay. All of that water flows through Bay County.  The devastating flood in mid-Michigan in 2020 occurred in Midland, Saginaw, Bay and surrounding Counties. That 500 year flood was a result of unusual natural events but especially devastating due to failure of critical infrastructure including the Edenville and Sanford Dams.  The need for government control of critical infrastructure was devastatingly illustrated by these dam failures. It is painfully apparent that policies are needed that protect critical infrastructure and this needs to be Federal.  And finally, there should be mention of the Higher Educational systems that students in all of these communities rely on. In 2016, 45% of students at SVSU were from the tri-counties and Genesee County.  Over 30% were from Bay and Saginaw Counties. Students who call these counties home are being trained in environmental studies to to conduct Field Studies on the Watershed and Rivers of these communities.  In addition the School of Health and Human Services provides professional degree programs for those local students to fill  jobs that are in high demand.  The University and Delta College U of M Flint and Mott Community College benefit from government funding in addition to local support. The illustrated needs of Bay, Saginaw, Midland Counties together with Flint/Genesee are not exhaustive. But I believe they are enough to show that these communities together have  cpncerns unique to their area as well as concerns typical of most cities. The aging infrastructure and population, the urban nature are particular to these 4 cities and their surrounding counties. While at the same time, this area is key to the health of the Great Lakes and we know it. Much is being done to protect our fresh water and the largest freshwater resource in the world. Please enable us to continue to advocate for necessary funding to protect our natural resources and our  residents and area for the future by keeping Bay County, Midland, Saginaw and Flint/Genesee together in a Congressional District. Thank you"

Please consider consolidating  District 19 as all of the City of Livonia as we are a community of shared interests and it is unfair to the City and to the residents of these precincts that they were carved out into another House District.  Historically, the City of Livonia, with a population of about 94,000,  has voted more conservatively.  The three districts carved out of District 19 have voted more liberally.  I am asking that all of the City of Livonia be kept as one House District as the population is only about 4% over the standard 90,000 population for a State House District."

Clearly, by their public actions in encouraging the submission of maps illustrating those communities, the Commission is  prioritizing this criterion.  I think this is a mistake.  The driving principle behind the campaign that resulted in the new petition-based law was to eliminate the evils on which  gerrymandering is predicated.  Creating districts based on any singular quality of voters is a form of such gerrymandering--is a discrimination not based on the democratic principle of the equality of all voters.  At its least offensive, discrimination based on the community of interest might be construed as defending voters against unfair or immoral discrimination such as been used many times in the US.  Identifying such groups with common descriptors could serve a guideline to preventing the diminution of their voting power.  But to deliberately create voting districts to enhance the voting success of any defined group is to discriminate unfairly against all the other voters in that district.  This is antithetical to good governance in the long run.  I believe the Commission would do well to make this criterion the least important of the laws driving its deliberations and actions.  It would be more in the interests of the people of Michigan if the Commission would adopt the goal of creating districts that enhance the fair and effective governance of the State (and the nation).  The present deadlocked, hyper partisan, uncompromising government is a burden on the electorate and a danger to the future of effective government.  We need a legislature and and an executive branch that can work together to solve our problems.  To that end we need districts that can send reasonable, moderate representatives that can accomplish the needs of the majority of the voters in the district.  That possibility can be enhanced by creating districts of heterogeneous voters, not voters whose sameness results in representatives with extreme views of a minority of the public.  Redistricting based on commonalities is a redistricting based on homogeneity of interest and has clearly resulted in governing bodies that are representative only of a small base of voters.  E Pluribus Unum.  Let's create districts that contain the maximum variety of Michiganders and then the candidates can compete fairly for their votes."

341,plan,ush,"flint,pontiac,flint-pontiac_congressional","Pontiac, Flint & Flint Metro League COIs","Proposed Congressional District  Based on Two Similar, Adjoining Communities of Interest and a Smaller, Overlapped Community of Interest  Submitted by:	Gary Morehead, Auburn Hills, MI See also Public Comment #6, Pontiac MICRC Hearing, 6/10/21  District Shape File:  https://districtr.org/plan/31973  Three Adjoining/Overlapping Communities of Interest •	District Level:  Congressional District •	Principle Focus:  Two similar non-major-metro central city economic hubs and their surrounding areas – Flint in Genesee County and Pontiac in Oakland County •	Secondary, Included Focus:  Northwestern Oakland County and Southern Genesee County school districts which form a cultural community of interest based on high school athletic competition •	Shared History:  The two central cities are former centers of the automobile industry – both being the homes of General Motors brands – Buick and Pontiac, respectively.  The surrounding areas are their “bedroom communities.”  For over 50 years, the residential communities of Fenton (which straddles the Oakland-Genesee-Livingston Counties borders), Holly (Oakland) and Schwartz Creek (Genesee) have shared in high school sports competition across county lines; gradually, other nearby districts joined them, including the border school districts of Brandon (Oakland) and Goodrich (Genesee) and most recently, Lake Fenton (Genesee, 2019).  High school sports are an important cultural activity in these areas and have bound these school districts together in friendly rivalry for a long time. •	Shared Interests:  The central cities are de-industrialized today.  They are rebuilding and revitalizing.  Along with their surrounding commuter residential areas they seek economic and employment development.  The economic interests of the residential areas are enhanced when the central cities prosper.  Where the two economic areas of shared interest adjoin, the area of shared sports activity overlaps the county line. •	Physical Connection:  The I-75 corridor is the main artery in this part of the state and connects the two areas.  The Flint and Pontiac areas adjoin each at the area served by the Fenton, Holly, Brandon and Goodrich school districts – all of which, again, compete together in the Flint Metro League. •	Aims:  Improve representation of unique re-developmental and growth needs of these two non-major-metro central cities and the people who live in them or live nearby and work in them, to maximize employment and economic development, and to maintain and reinforce the sense of community that exists at the border between the two counties. •	A large proportion of the workers who live in this proposed district also work there.    Included Central Cities •	Flint  •	Pontiac  Included Surrounding Areas •	All of Genesee County •	Northwestern portion of Oakland County generally along or near the I-75 corridor - the equivalent of just over 11 geographical townships –  o	Holly, Groveland, Brandon, Rose, Springfield, Independence, Orion, Highland, White Lake and Waterford townships, o	Jurisdictions within those geographical townships, including but not limited to (for example) the city of Lake Angelus, the city of the Village of Clarkston, and the city of Holly), and o	The cities of Sylvan Lake, Auburn Hills and Pontiac, and  o	The entirety of the City of Pontiac School District, including areas served by the district outside the city of Pontiac.  Flint, Pontiac and their respective school districts, and their respective surroundings constitute similar economic hub areas in that they are each a non-major-metro central city with a surrounding residential area.    The interests of these two central cities, their school districts, and their surrounding residential areas are different from those which might be found in a larger, major metro area like Detroit and surroundings.  People in these areas often turn towards the smaller- or more human-scale, away from the “big city” or “rat race” of the metropolitan area, sometimes being a little more “home grown” rather than nationally or globally oriented, and even in the central cities, maintaining some elements of “home town” or “small town” pride of place.  The city of Flint and its school district might be considered a community of interest by themselves.  The same could be said for the city of Pontiac and its school district.  However, in each case, there are many people who live outside the city/district and depend on work inside it for their financial well-being.  Therefore, a more comprehensive definition of each community of interest is also appropriate.  The representational interests of Pontiac and its nearby areas to the northwest in Oakland County will be better served in combination with those of Flint and its nearby areas in Genesee County than they would be in a Metropolitan Detroit oriented congressional district.  The same is true about combining the Flint & Genesee community of interest with that of Pontiac.  The people living between the two cities relish living away from “the city.”  With central city, suburban and rural areas, this proposed congressional district would have somewhat greater population diversity than the state as a whole.    This proposed district likely would be a “swing” district in which candidates of either major party could succeed, contributing much to an overall sense of fairness in Michigan’s congressional district map.  Reasons for Excluding Other Adjacent Residential Areas •	Tuscola and Saginaw Counties share more interests with the Tri-Cities area - Saginaw, Bay City and Midland •	Lapeer County shares more interests with other Thumb Counties •	Shiawassee County shares as many or more interests with Lansing or rural counties as it does with Flint •	Livingston County's interests are split between Lansing and the Detroit Metro Area •	Areas in Oakland County to the south of the designated area relate much more strongly to the Detroit Metro Area •	To the east of the designated area in Oakland County, Oakland Townships, Rochester and Rochester Hills relate more to the Detroit Metro Area (via highways M-24/Lapeer Road and M-150/ Rochester Road), and form their own community of interest, as members of that community have asserted, and along with Addison Township, they relate well to Macomb County communities immediately to their east, in terms of shopping and business patterns.  Whether to include parts of Oxford Township or Highland Township (or both or neither) in this Congressional District is mainly a matter of meeting the equal population requirement.  2020 Census data is not available at the time of this proposal.  For purposes of a congressional district proposal, the Genesee County lines have been used and, in Oakland County, geographical township and city lines.  It is recognized that these jurisdiction boundaries need not be adhered to by the commission, and there is not an exact definition of where community of interest lines must be drawn, particularly on the northern and western sides of Genesee County.  However, it is clear that: •	most of the population of Genesee County outside the city and school district of Flint have more in common with Flint than with Saginaw, Lansing or Lapeer; •	most people in the designated portion of Oakland County have more in common with Pontiac and northern Oakland County than with Livingston, Lapeer or Macomb Counties, or areas in southern Oakland County or Wayne County; and •	The school districts comprising the Flint Metro League, while they comprise a community of interest in and of themselves, also serve to connect the two larger Flint and Pontiac-based COIs.  Analysis  A congressional district with this set of boundaries: •	respects and includes three communities of interest, •	can be defined to meet the 2020 congressional district equal population requirement, •	includes a population more diverse than the state as a whole, is contiguous and compact, •	has equally balanced two-party vote shares - which encourages healthy, competitive elections in the district, and •	will keep Genesee County whole or approximately so.  Oakland County is too populous to be represented by a single Congressional District.

342,plan,house,west bloomfield township,West Bloomfield State House seat,"This district includes the West Bloomfield District plus a very small portion of Farmington in order to reach the preferred 88k population. This district is compact, very close knit within the community, and has a very strong balance in partisan fairness. Many communities all across the state have done a great job elaborating on their communities of interest. I have done so myself during my public comment at the Novi hearing in the spring, but now we must look to the broader implications of the maps as they fit together as a whole. There are certain communities within the state of Michigan, that due to their own unique cultures skew heavily to one partisan side or another. These imbalances are not perfect however, and when considering the overall composition of the electoral maps going forward their uneven weight should be mitigated where possible. The main reason why the people of Michigan voted for and demanded that this commission took the reigns of this process is to ensure that no one party had a disproportionate advantage in any given election. If 55% of the population of the state votes for one party, that party should hold roughly 55% of the seats in the house. If in the next election that party only wins 45% of the votes, their seat count should subsequently fall to 45% of the seats. For the last several cycles, the percentage of seats awarded in the Michigan House and Senate have been vastly different than the number of votes cast. To the best of its ability the commission must seek to eliminate these inefficiencies, while considering the many communities of interest the people of Michigan have provided to the commission. Thank you for your time and work. "
343,plan,house,"grandville city,wyoming city",Sue's state senate district,"As a resident of Grandville I was one of the many people who spoke at the July 1 meeting in GR that Grandville and Wyoming fit together perfectly to create a state senate district.  Since I was speaker #100  that night and everyone was a little tired by then, I am including a copy of my remarks.  My first suggestion is to follow county lines when possible. Grandville, where I live, is on the western border of Kent County.  I don’t think there’s even a sign to tell you when you drive out of Kent and into Ottawa County, but that invisible line makes a difference.    A couple years ago I injured my hand on a Sunday. I asked my phone for the closest urgent care and was directed to a facility in Jenison. They said I needed to see a hand surgeon, but because the med center was in Ottawa County they sent me to one at Holland Hospital , 25 miles away, instead of much closer specialists in Kent County.   Gerrymandered districts that zig zag across county lines cause similar problems. Take the current Second Congressional District.  It follows the Lakeshore except for a skinny, crooked finger that jabs into Kent County and snags voters like me from Grandville, Wyoming and Kentwood. This muffles our voices by burying us under a blanket of lakeshore voices and prevents us from impacting Kent County‘s Third Congressional District where we really belong.   I’m glad this commission is committed to drawing compact, contiguous districts with common interests. Grandville and Wyoming could be such a district.  I live on a little neighborhood lake in Grandville, but the people on the other side of the lake live in Wyoming.  That’s how intertwined these two towns are.  Our main drags,  28th street and 44th street, run parallel across both towns. That’s where we shop, and eat out and where many residents work every day.   The combined population of Grandville and Wyoming is roughly the number you are looking for in a House District. So there you have it,  a  perfect house district defined. One down, 109 to go.   "
344,plan,senate,,Royal Oak to Commerce State Senate,"Greetings Redistricting Commission. Attached you will find a map that highlights a potential State Senate district stretching from Royal Oak to Commerce township. This community of interest is important to myself, my family, and my friends. It represents the bulk of the area where we spend most of our time living, working, and playing. Our residence is in West Bloomfield township, we conduct most of our shopping in Commerce, and my wife commutes to Royal Oak Beaumont where se works as a Nurse Practitioner. This district is mostly compact and covers a string of communities with similar compositions. More importantly though it creates a district with a very close partisan divide that could swing the district in line with changing voter opinions. Districts with severe partisan advantage do a disservice not only to the people of Michigan as a whole, but to the districts residents as well. As many districts as possible should remain competitive while also considering intractable differences in certain districts that will heavily favor one party over another. Whatever the end result of the commissions efforts, the number of seats in the Michigan House and Senate should reflect the voting trends of the public at large. If 55% of the people vote for one party, roughly 55% of the seats should go to that party as well, and if that party only gets 45% of the votes the next election they should likewise only have 45% of the seats. Thank you again for your efforts and I look forward to the outcome of your decisions. "

I have lived and worked in Caledonia Township, Kent County, all of my adult life-over four decades.  It is a wonderful rural/semi-rural community that should be aligned with other semi-rural communities.  Residents here have chosen to live away from the bustle of the city and busy suburbs.   My State House District 86 currently crosses over the county line into Ionia County.  Certainly, when you are looking at communities of interest, the services of Kent County, including but not limited to the sheriff, road commission, Intermediate School District, courts, Dept of Public Works, correctional facilities, health department and parks should be represented in the State House within the boundaries of Kent County.  Please respect the boundary lines of the county when determining State House districts, starting with new maps instead of trying to tweak the old ones, which are unfairly partisan.  Our county is also split up among congressional districts because of gerrymandering.  Since Kent County is the fourth most populous county and Grand Rapids is the largest city in west Michigan and anchors the west side of the state, we need to have Kent County’s boundaries within a single congressional district.  Thanks, again, for your efforts to help Michigan get fair representation for all of its citizens."
367,plan,house,,William's balanced3 plan,
368,plan,house,,Theodore's Thumb region plan,"My first goal was to have districts of even populations and districts with shapes that made sense. I then tried to focus on populations that had things in common. For example, one of my first districts was linking the Grand Blanc, Fenton, and Holly areas together. They have similar economic interests, lifestyles, etc. I felt the same about district 2, linking Burton, Davison, and Goodrich together. I think there are strong connections between those communities. The thumb was easy, but I did change it slightly from the original. I thought it was important to have a district that followed most of Saginaw Bay including Bay City. I felt that it was important for Port Huron to have its own district and the surrounding area since it is an important border crossing. District 11 just south of Port Huron I thought should encompass all the land in that area just before the outer exurbs of Detroit. The Waterford communities I tried to keep in a compact shape that made sense. The city of Flint is split up mainly into two adjacent districts, but I think in the long run it is good to have some Flint and immediate suburban people in both districts to keep them competitive and have representation from both sides of town. In the outer bigger districts I tried to link main towns without breaking up the districts too much. "
369,plan,house,,Eric's North Berrien Map,"I reviewed a recent meeting held, and I appreciate the commission’s commitment to taking history of our communities into account while they draw districts for the 2022 election.  Since its founding, Berrien County has always been split into a North/South County mentality.  Our founding townships were St. Joseph Township and Niles Township. St. Joseph encompassing the Northern parts of the County and Niles including the Southern region.  As the committee looks to draw new lines for our county, I would encourage you to maintain the North/South lines we currently have.   Because of our history, natural communities of interest have formed amongst this split.  For our citizens to get news, our papers follow the North/South split.  In the North, the Tri-City Record covers Hagar, Coloma, Watervliet, and Bainbridge Township.  In the South, Leader Publications cover the southern communities.  These local media outlets cover local news and happenings in our communities and at our schools.  Because of this coverage that goes back generations, natural communities of interest have formed within the distribution areas of these papers.   As alluded to earlier, our schools also play an essential part in our communities of interest.  From the lines of the school districts to their sports teams, our schools in Southwest Michigan are the heart and soul of our communities.  Lakeshore vs. St. Joe, Coloma vs. Watervliet, Michigan Lutheran vs. Lake Michigan Catholic are all rivalries that date back generations.  Splitting up our communities into new gerrymandered districts would help tear apart our community; it wouldn’t bring us closer together.    Berrien County has always had a North/South split, naturally creating communities of interest.  I would encourage this commission to do everything it can to keep our communities together the way they are now and not tear them apart. "
370,plan,house,,Tom - North Berrien + Baroda,"As the commission looks to draw new lines for our districts at the state and federal level, I would encourage them to keep North and South Berrien County together.  Since our county is too big for one district, maintaining the North/South split is critical to preserving our communities of interest.   From a public safety point of view, our county has already split itself into a North/South territory relating to public safety.  In North Berrien County, the North Berrien Fire Rescue Department serves our northern townships of Hagar, Watervliet, Coloma, Benton, and Bainbridge. While our Sheriff’s Department has command posts in Niles City and St. Joseph City, splitting our officers into North and South Patrols.    As we discuss all the benefits of community policing, maintaining house and senate districts that overlap with municipal jurisdictions is critical as we look to preserve communities of interest.  As we work together on criminal justice reforms, maintaining these municipal police lines benefits everybody as the officers interact with the people of their communities who also interact with their representatives in Lansing and Washington.  As the commission looks to draw new lines, I strongly encourage you to maintain Berrien County’s Northern and Southern districts.    In this specific district, I’ve added Baroda to Michigan’s 79th House District.  It makes the most sense because they share a public safety force with Lake Township and are part of the Lakeshore School district which is based in Stevensville, but covers Baroda.  "
371,plan,house,,Rodney's AG Community - N/S Berrien,"As the commission looks to draw new lines for the state house and senate, I'm writing to encourage you to do everything you can to keep Michigan's Agricultural communities of interest intact.  Agriculture in Michigan is more than a $100 billion industry, with our state producing more than 300 commodities on a commercial basis, including tart cherries, blueberries, dry beans, floriculture products, and cucumbers for pickles.  Berrien County is the crown jewel of the fruit belt. Our farmers not only feed the nation but also contribute to our community's booming tourism industry.   It's no secret that farmers' markets are popular.  Almost every town in Berrien County has some sort of roadside fruit stand or weekly farmers market throughout the summer, which are visited by both locals and tourists alike.  As the commission seeks to draw new lines, I encourage you to maintain our agricultural communities.    While the more rural areas of our County grow the product, it's sold in farmers' markets in our cities- creating a symbiotic relationship.  St. Joseph, Bridgman, and Benton Harbor all have farmers' markets or open-air markets which attract vendors from Coloma, Watervliet, and Bainbridge Township.  This natural relationship formed by our Northern Communities is an excellent reason why this commission should maintain Berrien County's Northern and Southern House districts.  Agriculture and Tourism are two of the largest industries in our state, and as decisions are made in Lansing, it's important the representatives we send there have a holistic understanding of our community's naturally occurring relationships.  A coastal community/district may understand the tourism impact but not the agricultural impact, while the inverse may be said about a purely rural district.    As drawn now, we have two districts that include both coastal communities and rural communities that form a natural community of interest in terms of growing our agricultural and tourism industries.  Our representatives, past, current, and future, regardless of party, go to Lansing with a holistic approach and understanding of our state's two largest industries and the benefits they offer our local communities.    I encourage you to take and maintain the districts in a similar fashion so Berrien County can continue sending representatives to Lansing that understand our tourism and agricultural industries – advancing policies that grow our economy and make life better for every resident of Southwest Michigan. "
372,plan,house,,Steve - Municipalities,"There is nothing that describes a community of interest more than a local municipality, be it a city, township, or village.  Local control is always paramount, and if you ask any voter, they'd prefer more decisions to be made at the local level instead of a faraway capital.    If this commission splits up municipal lines, it would be the single greatest disservice to the people of Michigan in recent memory.  Currently, municipal leaders closest to the people respond to what they hear from their residents and advance policies that their communities want. These municipal leaders speak with their representatives and senators in Lansing and Washington as the voices of their communities.  Splitting municipalities up would severely water down the influence of communities and ensure that residents' voices aren't heard.  In Berrien County, they've taken it one step further by creating a ""best practices"" committee where municipal leaders gather together to advance common policies that they all support.  When one community applies for a grant, they are supported by all the other committee members.  They understand that when one of them wins, it benefits the entire region.    I'm asking you to preserve municipal lines and not water down residents' voices and stomp on the good work that is already happening in Berrien County.  This commission has the opportunity to do the right thing, and I hope they do so by preserving municipal lines and their communities of interest.   "

397,plan,house,,Powell Townships/Marquette County,"Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission: August 8, 2021 Dear Commission, I enjoyed meeting and conversing with some of you at the MICRC meeting in Marquette on May 18, 2021. I am writing you to please consider removing Powell Township from the current 110th State House District to the current 109th State House District. However the districts are formed and perhaps renumbered during redistricting after receiving the census data, Powell Township in Marquette County Michigan needs to be in the same district as Marquette Township and the City of Marquette. The reasons for this request are necessitated through Powell Township’s shared Communities of Interest with Marquette Township and the City of Marquette, as well as Marquette County as a whole. •	Powell shares the only paved road into and out of our township with Marquette Township and the City of Marquette •	Driving the 70 miles of paved road to get to Baraga County in the outskirts of the eastern 110th district, we must pass through seven other Marquette County townships and the Cities of Marquette, Negaunee, and Ishpeming. o	It is 96 miles to L’Anse the closest “large” town (pop. 2,000) in the 110th District to Big Bay. L’anse is the County Seat in Baraga County.  •	Our State House Representatives since 2002 have all lived 3-4 hours away from Powell Township: Bessemer, Atlantic Mine, Calumet, and Hancock. We rarely see them. •	Powell Township barely touches Baraga County on our western border (7 miles and laps over Michigamme Twp). The entire population of year round Powell Township residents live on the eastern border near Lake Superior and Marquette Township. Ishpeming Township, also currently in the 110th District, is completely surrounded by Marquette County townships. •	High school students in Powell Township attend school in either Negaunee or Marquette. •	The Marquette County Road Commission services our roads •	Other than frequenting our small town gas/grocery store and restaurants we make our major food, building supply, and entertainment choices in the City of Marquette or Marquette Township. •	Some residents attend church in Marquette; there are two churches in Big Bay, Powell Township. •	The majority of Powell Township residents work in the City of Marquette or surrounding townships •	The closest hospital, doctors, and medical facilities are in the City of Marquette. We coordinate with ambulance services from the City of Marquette and Duke LifePoint/Marquette General Hospital. •	Powell residents share a contiguous coastline on Lake Superior with Marquette Township, Chocolay Township, and the City of Marquette.  •	Any mail that gets delivered along County Road 550 from the City of Marquette to “Downtown” Big Bay has a Marquette address and zip code. •	For these reasons our community interests are shared predominantly with the City of Marquette and Marquette Township. The citizens of Powell Township deserve fair representation that shares and understands our needs and our aspirations for the future. The residents of Powell Township need to be represented by people we know and see in our community. Redrawing an area as unique as the Upper Peninsula requires a recognition of those factors that make our geography, demographics, Communities of Interests, and historical alliances unique. The challenge you will have will require you to allow yourself some “wiggle room” regarding equal population between districts. It is imperative that you leave counties intact. If you try, as I have, peeling off county border townships to equalize the Michigan House Districts in the UP the result causes more harm than good. The situation described above that applies to Powell and Ishpeming Township residents is but an example. I have tried removing and adding outlying townships to adjoining counties and it really adds nothing of significance in terms of population. Most outlying townships have populations from 700 – 1,000 residents at the most. The largest cities, usually only one per county tend to be in the middle of the county. If a ‘large” city is near an adjacent county/district line it will add or subtract to many residents to/from a district. In a nutshell, drawing maps with perfectly equal house districts in the UP will severely damage Communities of Interest and deny residents equal and fair representation. The priority ranking of Communities of Interest in our constitution requires that you pay this more attention than perfectly equal population between districts achieved by breaking up counties to actuate equal population. The sample map I am submitting in the link below represents what many citizens reflected on when the MICRC held a hearing in Marquette on May 18, 2021. Communities of Interests in the UP tend to follow an east-west travel route rather than a north – south travel route. This is probably due to historic European settler and development routes. This is reflected today in our major transportation routes which run east – west, most notably M-28 and US-2 which traverse the entire peninsula. The north – south routes are shorter as is the distance between Lake Michigan and Lake Superior. The map I am submitting reflects the comments made by many at the May 18th hearing and the information provided above. The districts follow an east and lake pattern. One district encompasses Lake Superior, one district encompasses Lake Michigan, and one district encompasses the western UP. I realize that currently Mackinac and Chippewa Counties are combined with some Lower Peninsula Counties. I am not sure how that will play out when the census figures are released. I do know that whatever you do, PLEASE KEEP POWELL TOWNSHIP AND ISHPEMING TOWNSHIP IN THE SAME DISTRICT AS THE REST OF MARQUETTE COUNTY. https://districtr.org/plan/34624  Thank you for your hard work on the commission and considering my recommendation.

Public transportation like “The Ride” runs various lines in an interconnected fashion between Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti.  “The Ride” also has a route to Romulus and DTW.  Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti are inseparable communities as the area around Washtenaw Avenue features an indistinguishable border between the two similar communities. Numerous groups like the regional Chamber of Commerce define districts with these two at the center. Not to mention the similarities between having two major D1 Universities: UM and EMU.  Saline, Dexter, Plymouth, Scio Township, Pittsfield Township, and Superior Township are very reliant on the city of Ann Arbor-Ypsi and work as suburbs to the bigger metropolitan city. Property values, school systems, and the like mirror each other. This community of interest also contains valued ethnic communities like the Asian-American and Black communities amongst others.  While Brighton has its own cultural identity beyond the metro center of Ann Arbor-Ypsi, many factors still connect the two areas, possibly the most important being the natural environment. The Huron Valley Watershed contains both areas and creates areas like Whitmore Lake in between which is used for recreation for many in both places. I’m also of the belief for those passionate about the environment, it makes sense to take in mind watersheds as representatives will be more attentive to needs in this case.  Having lived in Ann Arbor for decades, this map resembles the GPS my phone would show. Whether it has been work, my children’s schools, outdoor recreation, sporting events, shopping, transportation, or anything else, ultimately, this is an indivisible community that adjoins all aspects of life.  Currently, this sensible community is split amongst many congressional districts(MI12, MI11, MI8, MI7) and I look forward to the commission rectify this error.   I am happy the commission is taking into account the communities of interest and strongly recommend referring to this map. Anything outside of this map or potentially Ann Arbor adjoining metro Detroit, or creating a Lansing-Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti (university-centered) district, splitting these communities again would be a terrible mistake as there are few communities across Michigan so independent and obvious."

427,coi,,,Dunham Lake,"Dunham Lake is a private lake straddling the borders of Livingston and Oakland counties in Southeast Michigan split roughly in half by the county line. The same county line also separates State house, senate, and US congress districts in addition to local school and municipalities (Hartland and Highland). There are approximately 400 property owners who live around Dunham Lake in communities planned primarily to conserve the natural beauty of the lake and allow them access to the water via a protected greenbelt.   Dunham Lake is a 110-acre glacial lake that was formed anywhere from 7,000 to 10,000 years ago from a block of ice broken off by the retreating glacier - a so-called 'kettle lake'. Dunham has three deep basins, the deepest one about 125 feet, making it one of the deepest, if not the deepest lake in Southeast Michigan.   In the 1920's Henry M. Wallace began buying up all available land around the lake to protect its natural beauty. Henry had heard a talk by the noted Canadian bird enthusiast, Jack Miner, who had a bird sanctuary in Ontario along the migratory flyway. Inspired by Miner, Henry decided to use his Dunham Lake property for the same purpose. Trees were planted caretakers hired and wild rice sown in the shallows of the lake to attract Canada Geese. The area became a State Wildlife Refuge and Federal Game Preserve.   Upon Wallace's death in 1949, a consortium of five businessmen, headed by former governor of Michigan, Murray D. Van Wagoner (1940-42) purchased it in its entirety. However, the seller imposed certain restrictions on the deed. And the purchaser was required to submit a plan to preserve the beauty and purity of the lake. It was Van Wagoner who came up with the idea of the greenbelt and it was incorporated into the development plan as a valuable guard against lake ecosystem degradation.  The greenbelt surrounding 70 percent of the lake varies in width from about 100 to almost 400 feet. Cedar trees, planted in the 1930's, abound as do other conifers, towering hardwoods such as oak, cherry, hickory, and maple, along with berry producing shrubs, a favorite with the numerous birds in the area. Walking paths run along the lake and up on the higher ridges in the greenbelt, allowing residents to enjoy the dense woods, wildlife, and lakefront views. The lake freezes over in the winter creating opportunities for ice fishing, ice skating, and cross-country skiing. The DNR does not allow motors of any kind on Dunham Lake.   Residents from around Dunham Lake conduct their lives in the communities of Hartland, Brighton, Highland, and Milford. Children on the Livingston County side attend Hartland Schools. Children on the Oakland County side attend Huron Valley Schools. Many residents work in Milford at the GM Proving Grounds or own or work at businesses in Hartland, Brighton, Highland, or Milford. Most residents shop for groceries and hardware in Hartland, Highland, Milford, and Brighton.  The transportation corridors running north, and south are US23, Pleasant Valley/Fenton Road, Hickory Ridge, and Milford Road. The corridors running east, and west are Clyde Road, M59, and Interstate 96.  Our principal concern is that Dunham Lake and the residential community that surrounds it has been in existence since the early twentieth century, yet our representation at all levels has been fragmented. It would be nice to have one state representative, one state senator, and one US congress person to interact with for our needs as a historical lakefront community with environmental priorities. Dunham Lake is a state treasure.  https://districtr.org/COI/23218 "

We also have similar educational interests in skilled trades.

Distinctive small towns scatter across the landscape of counties like Jackson, Calhoun, Lenawee, Monroe, Hillsdale, Branch, St. Joseph, and much of Eaton. They all provide valuable one-of-a-kind experiences, and all demonstrate the natural, and often rural qualities that nature-lovers enjoy.   I crafted a community map that resembles how my neighbors see our community as a whole. Areas like Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti, Lansing, and Kalamazoo provide lively and high-spirited opportunities. There are many positive qualities those areas possess, but many of the issues they encounter do not correlate with those issues encountered by rural and undeveloped areas. To me, nothing is more important than community, and I sincerely hope the commission keeps this in mine as they endeavor on this difficult task of drawing the districts. Finally, I hope my feedback is valuable in the process for the commissioners."

That helped us support each other in the difficult years that followed.  Our neighborhood went through a lot. When unemployment soared  and Detroit housing values plunged in the 1980s, city taxes remained high and few people knew about the Hardship exemption that could have helped save their homes. Meanwhile, banks were promoting mortgages they knew people didn’t understand and couldn’t afford. That double whammy created a wave of foreclosures and vacated homes. But through mutual support we made it through those hard years so well that we were later voted – twice! -- the best neighborhood in Detroit. The communities on either side of EEV, Morningside and Cornerstone, also faced daunting problems of depopulation and devasted housing stock. So they also organized into associations of mutual support and camaraderie, with multi-racial participation.  A few years ago our three neighborhoods founded the MECCA Development Corporation to help us work together to revitalize the area and offer resources to young people. (This became especially important after the City closed the Recreation Center that used to be next to the High School.) One of our main shared projects is to redevelop the distressed East Warren commercial strip that runs through all three neighborhoods.  At a time when local movie theaters vanished from neighborhoods en masse, a determined group of citizens organized to save the abandoned Alger Theater on the border between East English Village and Morningside. It is being revitalized and sponsors art and other events.  With help from the city and other resources, we founded the East Warren Development Corp that is spurring small businesses to locate in the area and now runs a farmers market on Warren. The beautiful Balduck Park that’s within Cornerstone also has been revamped with support from the UAW and other funders, and residents have organized farms and community gardens. We have a good rapport with the 5th police Precinct that serves our neighborhood. We all share a wonderful public library on Warren. And one of the most unique and beloved Detroit entertainment venues, Cadieux Café, on the Cornerstone side of Cadieux, attracts patrons from all over the Metro area. We also have Ascension St. John Hospital and several fitness centers, including LA Fitness. Nonetheless, our neighborhoods were very poorly served by past redistricting. For no apparent reason, all three neighborhoods were split into two separate State House districts. That made it harder for us to work together to bring attention to our needs. And the absurdly gerrymandered 14th Congressional District left us represented by a Congressperson who lives far away in Southield and had the impossible task of serving pieces of dozens of disparate communities that stretched all the way to Pontiac.  We desperately need shared representation closer to home. We need compact districts that unite rather than divide us, and that allow our representative to more easily participate and learn from our community, and serve its citizens."

We deserve to be represented by 1 congressional district, 2 state house districts, and 1 state senate district.  This commission can help the Southern Grand Rapids Metropolitan Community of Interest by drawing district lines that keep our community whole. "

Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commision MICRC  PO Box 30318 Lansing MI 48909  Dear Commissioners,  The area of Oxford, Lake Orion, Addison, & Brandon townships all share alike objectives of their communities. They work with each other to share services and ideas to create better communities. They work with groups of people from different areas and backgrounds get together to solve problems that affect them all and should be termed a “community of interest”.  They work together to learn from each other and help each other think of solutions everybody can use to make things better in their own areas.  The value in this community of interest is in their ability to help each other to do things better or quicker or cheaper than they could do if each local government worked on their own because of their shared objectives for their communities. The energy and excitement they have had and will have, being continued as the 46th District, the more quickly their problems get solved.  People in these communities of Oxford, Lake Orion, Addison, & Brandon townships get to know each other and talk to each other, although they might not even meet face to face or work together every day. Some might be at every single event; some might only come to one. Some might already know a lot about the problem, others might know nothing, but these people can still help the rest of the group by saying what they think about ideas or passing on what they have learned to other people they know.  This sharing of ideas and solutions as well as problems is what should be done everywhere. This ability to share services and ideas to create better communities that has like and shared objectives is what the 46th district of Oxford, Lake Orion, Addison, & Brandon townships is all about and should be considered a Community of Interest.  Many kind regards,   Ron Renaud Addison Township, Michigan"

We have an ongoing relationships with Morningside and Cornerstone neighborhoods, and we are a part of the City of Detroit.  Many of us work, play, shop, and vote within Detroit.  When our neighborhoods meet (we have regularly scheduled monthly meetings), topics of discussions are focused on the city.  For example, we have a development plan that coveres both East English Village and Morningside, or if there are updates from the police department, we are in the same precinct.  Even though we are on the edge of the city, we want to be kept with the rest of Detroit, particularly in the election process for the representation of our voices.   "
440,coi,,"tricounty,mid michigan,greater lansing,lansing",Tri-County Greater Lansing COI,"Commission members, thank you for your important work.  The Greater Lansing region includes Clinton, Eaton, and Ingham Counties. The three counties are actually a formal planning region in Michigan, and for good reason. Although there are diverse communities within this region, ranging from quite urban to quite rural, the entire area is centered on the Lansing Metro area - indeed, each county contains part of the urban and suburban complex of Lansing.   Further, the region's economy and employment is highly linked, particularly to State Government, General Motors, and large hospital and university entities in the core of the area. Smaller towns in the tri-county Greater Lansing area (e.g., Charlotte, Mason, Saint Johns, Eaton Rapids) all have large proportions of their workforce commute to those large employers, as well as others in the core area.  This region is currently fragmented into various districts, and this has diluted the area's political voice. Keeping the region together would address this problem.   Disclosure: I'm a professor at Michigan State University in this region. I am sensitive to the great local diversity within this region, just as there is in most if not all parts of the state. Still, I think keeping these areas together is on balance better than splitting them, as the region works as a large community of interest across several key characteristics."

A large portion of the communities living in this area are living under the poverty threshold. As an example, based on City-Data.com, the estimated median household income in Hamtramck in 2019 was $29,149.   With that said, given that there are a lot of Arabic, Bangla, Ukrainian, Bosnian speakers, amongst others, in the area, a lot of residents experience linguistic isolation. In other words, large groups are not included in government and research institutes' processes to collect socio-economic data. This means that the poverty rate is likely higher than is reflected by official numbers and that the ethnic makeup of the area is not fully reflected.   Moreover, given these demographics, it is no surprise that these communities at large are faced with extreme levels of environmental injustice. The area was home to the largest municipal waste incinerator in the US until it closed its doors in 2019 after 40 years of grassroots community advocacy. There is still much work left to be done. Despite this major victory, the area remains an industrial Sacrifice Zone and is home to numerous industrial sites, such as US Ecology North and South (hazardous waste processing plants), PVS Chemicals, GM Factory ZERO (also known as Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center), I-94 Industrial Park, Mt. Elliot Industrial Corridor, Strong Steel Scrap Yard, Hamtramck Recycling, American Axle, federal train tracks, CNN railroad, truck routes, junk yards, the William Dickerson Detention Facility, Detroit Detention Center, and Wayne County jail, which is under construction.   Residents of the area are also faced with blight, food deserts (in 48211 and 48212), illegal dumping, unsafe housing, and high energy and water bills, which they spend a disproportionate amounts of their income on.   As a result, residents of the area have suffered from chronic respiratory diseases, lower birth weights, and higher mortality rates both in general and throughout the COVID crisis, than in the rest of Michigan.     Simultaneously, rents are rising in places like Hamtramck and Milwaukee Junction as a result of  gentrification.  Despite all these injustices, communities in the area have demonstrated incredible resilience  across the decades. They have organized around these issues to find creative solutions to these problems.   The area is home to many Detroit and Hamtramck staples, such as numerous urban gardens, culturally diverse restaurants, Yemen Cafe, 1923 Cafe, Oloman Cafe, Iyengar Yoga, the Detroit Zen Center, Georgia Street Community Collective, the Russell Industrial Center, Better Made Chips, Kowalski Sausage,  Al Haramain International Foods, numerous cultural and community groups, as well as social service providers.   It is an area well worth visiting and supporting! Please be sure that as you redistrict Michigan, you keep communities like ours intact. "

As an adult, I have also lived in Grosse Pointe Woods and now live with husband and kids in Grosse Pointe Park.  My community of interest is the Lake St. Clair Community of Interest.  This includes all of the cities around the coast of Lake St. Clair, including Harsen's Island, New Baltimore, Harrison Twp., St. Clair Shores, and the 5 Grosse Pointes.    What distinguishes these towns is their shared interest in Lake St. Clair, their shared nautical feel, and their shared history.   All of these towns have lakefront amenities, which is why people choose to live and work in them.  These towns share a lakefront economy, with marinas, dining, and fishing.    These communities also have common interests in water management, storm and sewer outflows, and floodplain management.    From my time living in Grosse Pointe and in Macomb County, I know that the County line is an artificial barrier when it comes to dividing this Lake St. Clair Community of Interest (actually Grosse Pointe Shores is in both Macomb and Wayne Counties).  The thing that binds us together is the Lake (a natural feature) and the fact that we are all nautical cities.  "

This also represents the Eastside suburbs of Detroit, which are often overlooked in comparison to the suburbs in Oakland County and those west of Gratiot/I-94 in Macomb County.  The Lake St. Clair Community has distinct interests from the other Detroit suburbs.    Please note that communities of interest are higher priority than county lines under current law.  This is a reversal from the prior law, which mandated that this community of interest be divided because it includes parts of 3 counties.  Finally, note that if the water of Lake St. Clair were ""filled-in"" the shape of any district containing this community of interest would be roughly rectangular.

Those are the larger assets of the community.  The smaller but just as important assets are educational institutions to include Wayne County Community College Districts Eastern Campus, Several Detroit Public School Community District High Schools, Middle Schools, and Elementary Schools.

My husband has served as Block Captain for twenty-four years!  I have served in various capacities including Editor of our monthly newsletter, First Vice President of EEVA, an advisory member of the E. Warren Streetscape Team as well as being involved in reviewing proposals that developers are submitting for project sites along the E. Warren Business Corridor.  We often refer to East English Village as the “Cheers” of all neighborhoods ~ where everyone knows your name.  Truly there is no where else that we’d rather live, work, play and pray!  Our friendly and committed neighbors to the east, “Cornerstone”, and our neighbors to the west, “Morningside” work together with us on various projects and events including restoration of the historic Alger Theater, significant improvements at Balduck Park, building and supporting various community gardens, Arts & Scraps programming for children and adults, the Monthly Senior Luncheon co-sponsored by EEV and Bethany Christian Church, registering our children and grandchildren at the various sports facilities (MAC Athletic Complex, Lakeside Baseball Club, Eastside Tennis & Fitness Club, Balduck Park), our Thursday Farmers & Craft Market, events at the Jefferson Branch of our Detroit Public Library, Detroit Police Department-sponsored activities and, most recently, collaborating on ideas for the new E. Warren Streetscape housing our central business corridor.  This plan was developed via strong engagement with all three communities in an effort to design a beautiful, walkable, functioning business environment that would be supported by the residents. After months of meetings (via ZOOM during Covid19), the final plans were presented by Mayor Mike Duggan on May 26.  Residents voted and overwhelmingly (72-2) chose a plan with construction slated for 2022.  Even the Mayor commented that he’d never seen such a congenial group come to such a conclusive decision so quickly with minimal debate and without negative comments.  This was due to the fact that representatives from all three neighborhoods had been involved from the beginning and kept the residents informed throughout the process of the various options, thus answering many of their question and addressing concerns prior to the final presentation.   We are three neighborhoods united together except when it comes time to vote – as all three communities have been split into two State House districts.  The gerrymandering negatively impacted our Congressional voice as well since it encompasses an area of 40+ miles from Detroit to Pontiac.  We feel strongly that our three neighborhoods ~ a strong voting bloc that turns out for Local, State and Federal elections ~ should not be split up when it comes time to redistrict the State of Michigan.  In addition, I would like to see the Detroit Jefferson/Chalmers neighborhood (which abuts Morningside to the south) as well as Grosse Pointe Park and Grosse Pointe City also included in our new District. These cities share our common quality of life concerns and are working together to achieve improvement beyond the borders.  The Mack Avenue Improvement Project is just one example of the residents of the various neighborhoods working in conjunction with City administration and planning departments to design a new plan for Mack Avenue.  Residents of Detroit and the Grosse Pointes strongly support the local businesses and restaurants in each of the various communities.  Residents on both sides of the Detroit/Grosse Pointe borders are working together to find common ground to better ensure that each city does not remain its own little island. Teamwork is dreamwork as the saying goes.  In conclusion, my recommendation would be to keep the entire Detroit communities of East English Village, Morningside, Cornerstone and Jefferson/Chalmers along with Grosse Pointe Park and Grosse Pointe City as part of one of the newly-designed districts.  Thank you for this opportunity to submit our ideas and reviewing and considering our recommendations.  I look forward to viewing the new redistricting plan upon its completion."

Having lived in downtown Detroit for 16 years, I was excited about all the beautiful, affordable, and well-built brick homes in East English Village.  Many of these homes with their unique characteristics were designed by the original owners.  East English Village was also home to many Police Officers, Firefighters, Doctors, Lawyers, and other professionals, and with a diverse population.  I viewed many homes in East English Village, Cornerstone, Jefferson Chalmers, and Morningside.  I decided to purchase a brick home on Harvard in East English Village.  East English Village, Cornerstone, and Morningside have all gone through some very hard times.  Housing values dropped in the 1980s, but the city taxes remained high, and unemployment grew rapidly.  All this making it difficult for many long-time residents to stay afloat and be able to stay in their homes.  Cornerstone and Morningside suffered greatly with many foreclosures.  A large number of homes became vacant to be left neglected and blighted.  East English Village was able to pull together and was able to fair better.  East English Village has recently been voted 2 years in succession as the best neighborhood in Detroit.  East English Village, Cornerstone, Jefferson Chalmers, and Morningside all have organized Block Clubs that provide valuable information to their residents.  It is all helping to pull us together, stabilizing efforts to improve our neighborhoods.  We all have monthly meetings and elected officials.  East English Village and Morningside have newsletters to help reach those who cannot get to meetings..  East English Village, Cornerstone, and Morningside Communities share many amenities.  The Historic Alger Theater is one of only two unchanged neighborhood theaters still standing in Detroit.  It is currently being revitalized by a determined group of our citizens to get it fully operable once again.  The Cadieux Cafe offers live entertainment, attracting patrons from all around.  Jefferson Branch of the Detroit Public Library has been updated and is available for us to use.  East English Village, Cornerstone, and Morningside founded the MECCA Development Corporation which helps us work together to provide resources to our young people.  A key issue because our children are our future.  There is also Balduck Park getting some updating.  We also have some beautiful Community Gardens.  With help from the City, East Warren/Cadieux Development Plan, and our three neighborhoods working together a plan has been developed to revitalize the East Warren commercial business district.  We now have a Farmer's Market on the East Warren Corridor.  Our 5th Police Precinct encompasses East English Village, Cornerstone, Jefferson Chalmers, and Morningside Neighborhoods.  They work closely with us to provide community support.  We have Neighborhood Police Officers (NPOs) who cover our areas.  They work primarily with issues and problems specific to their certain Scout Car Area.  They also attend their areas monthly Block Club Meeting with updates and answer questions that citizens may have.  Our Commander, Commander Ewing, holds Procedural Justice and Restorative Practice Community Meetings as well as Domestic Violence Summit Meetings to strengthen relationships between the police and the citizens.  There is a monthly 5th Precinct Community Meeting in which people from East English Village, Cornerstone, Jefferson Chalmers, and Morningside attend.  The Commander, the Captain, NPO's and other Officers are usually in attendance with any updates and other helpful information for us as well as answering questions from us.  We also have MEC Neighborhood Patrol that is an organized, dedicated group of people who patrol the streets watching for unusual or criminal activity in the 5th Precinct.  We have police radios to use while on patrol that put in touch with the precinct when necessary.  Keeps our neighborhoods a little safer, and also adds extra eyes for our officers.  We also have many ties with the surrounding cities of Grosse Pointe Park, Grosse Pointe, Harper Woods, Grosse Pointe Farms and Hamtramck, as well as other eastside neighborhoods and  downtown Detroit. Just as I did, many of our neighbors moved here from downtown. We attend each other's cutltural events and shop in all those neighborhoods. Many children from our neighborhood atend St. Clair School in Grosse Point Park.  It is important to me to keep our neighborhoods solid and stable.  There is definitely a need for good schools for our children.  More accessible and reliable transportation is also key to our stability.  Our residents need fresh food markets and grocery stores.  Good Police Protection, which I feel we have a good relationship there already.  Always room to make it better.  In the past our neighborhoods have not been properly served.  Our neighborhoods have been split between 2 separate State House Districts which has made it difficult for us to work together on our like and shared needs.  It is relevant that we need compact districts which can unite not divide us.  This would also make it easier for our representative to participate and better understand our needs.  We have like needs and shared interests from the City all the way East along the river, and through our neighborhoods. "

456,coi,,,Macatawa Park area,"My name is Lisa Jevens and I have a home in Macatawa Park. Macatawa Park is a very special community of several hundred historic cottages dating from the 1800’s on Lake Michigan, just south of the Holland, MI lighthouse. It is a beautiful peninsula that lies between Lake Michigan and Lake Macatawa. The Macatawa Park Cottagers’ Association (MPCA) is our volunteer homeowner association. Macatawa itself is not a town, but it does have a post office, a large marina and yacht club. The reason I am writing this testimony is because for decades, the Macatawa community (peninsula) has been split in half horizontally along an imaginary line that is an extension of 32nd Street in Holland, running east to west. Everything to the north of 32nd Street is in Ottawa County and Park Township. Everything to the south is in Allegan County and Laketown Township. What does this have to do with redistricting? Unfortunately, the lines for our Congressional Districts, State Senate Districts and State House Districts were also drawn to follow this imaginary line. So everyone in the north part of Macatawa is in the 2nd Congressional District, the 30th State Senate and 98th State House District. Everyone to the south is in the 6th Congressional District, the 26th State Senate and 80th State House District. We should be represented by ONE person in each legislative body, not two. Some of the issues we are facing are high water on both lakes and severe beach erosion. We had to spend a lot of money on revetment in 2020 and our beach access is still compromised. It makes it more difficult for our community to address this if we have to consult two Congressmen, two State Senators and two State Representatives. I believe Macatawa should be represented together as one,  joined with the beach communities to the south on Lake Michigan and to the east on Lake Macatawa. This is our community where we share the same interests, challenges and activities. 32nd Street (and its extension westward) should no longer be a dividing line. "

The most well known is that they share the Rapid Transit System. They also partner together to send all their garbage to the incinerator which burns garbage to produce energy. This is the only incinerator that remains in use in Michigan. Many of the 6 cities also partner with the city of Grand Rapids on water and sewer, such as Kentwood, East Grand Rapids, and Walker. The 6 cities also share a form of government that is dramatically different than surrounding townships. Cities have their own police departments, fire departments, park systems, and they take care of their own streets. To the contrary, townships rely on county services such as the county sheriff, volunteer fire departments, the county park systems, the county road commission, and they deliver fewer services because they are restricted to 5 mils of taxes.

I grew up in Westland and attended Wayne-Westland schools, including Wayne Memorial High School in Wayne. I now live in Livonia, and my son attended Livonia public schools for his entire K-12 education. I also lived in Plymouth for a short time.  I believe that K12 school districts, especially in the Detroit Metro area, should play a large part in creating communities of interest. Therefore, my map encompasses the Wayne-Westland school district, which now includes parts of Wayne, Westland, and Inkster; it also includes the Livonia district, which includes parts of Westland, and the Plymouth-Canton district, among others.  Beyond school districts, there is some commonality (e.g., average income, age of houses and infrastructure, home value, educational attainment, etc.) among inner ring/older suburbs like Redford, Livonia, and Dearborn as well as long-established western communities like Plymouth, Northville, and Farmington, which are a popular destinations for those living in the western suburbs. Hines Park, which runs through communities such as Dearborn, Westland, Livonia, Plymouth, and Northville, is also a popular gathering place and point of reference. Other important and familiar institutions include Schoolcraft Community College and Madonna University (both in Livonia), Greenfield Village/The Henry Ford and University of Michigan-Dearborn (both in Dearborn), Twelve Oaks Mall in Novi, and more. Expressways such as I-96, I-275, and parts of M-14 also tie the community together, as do Plymouth Road, Ford Road, Michigan Avenue, Schoolcraft, and the mile roads of 5 Mile up to about 13 Mile.   I am a bit less familiar with the southern areas, and some northern areas, of my map so some tweaking may be needed, especially when it comes to school district vs. municipality, but overall I think the map and the above details represent the Western Suburbs community of interest rather well, much more so than the current congressional district 11, which includes parts of Livonia, Plymouth, Northville, and Canton but also “lake” communities like Walled Lake, Waterford, and Commerce Township and more affluent northern suburbs like Birmingham, Bloomfield Hills, and Rochester Hills.

468,coi,,"kent,grand rapids city,east grand rapids city",Six Metro City Community of Interest,"As a resident of East Grand Rapids, I’m writing to ask you to keep the core metro six cities together as much as possible in state house, state senate, and congressional districts.   These urban cities (Grand Rapids, Walker, Grandville, Walker, Kentwood, and East Grand Rapids) are significantly different from the surrounding townships that are mostly rural or far out suburban and therefore are interested in different laws coming from Lansing and DC.   First, these two groups divide themselves on a state-wide and local level. At the state level, cities are organized into the Michigan Municipal League and townships are in the Michigan Townships Association. Here in Kent County, the six cities meet in the Urban Metro Mayors and Managers and the townships get together as the Kent County Township Supervisors group. So, you can see that when municipalities group into federations they divide cities from townships, and you should do the same.   Second, cities and townships are just different in Michigan law, in how their residents encounter local government, and in the issues that they deal with.  Cities have their own police departments, fire department, parks, and have water/sewer infrastructure. A representative from a city will be more focused on working on behalf of cities and their particular issues.  Townships are not allowed to have more than 2 (by trustees) or 5 (with voter approval) mills of property taxes, so they offer far fewer services. They tend to rely on state and county governments for their law enforcement (the Sheriff), parks, and roads (county road commission). Township residents in Michigan tend to have septic systems and wells, instead of being on piped water and sewer. A representative from a township will be more focused on working on behalf of townships and their particular and unique issues.  Finally, the six metro cities combine with only themselves on services such as public transit (The Rapid) and garbage (the incinerator).   So, for all of these reasons, try to draw maps that keep cities with cities and townships with townships. In Kent County, that means keeping the core six cities together as much as possible. In the last gerrymandered state house map, East Grand Rapids was put together with exurban and rural townships that don't share our interests and I think that shouldn't happen this time. Thanks. "

471,coi,,,Frenchtown Township's Resort District Au,"My COI is the Frenchtown Resort District Authority in Monroe County.  The Resort Authority was created 20+ years ago as a result of the need to build and maintain infrastructure for the area of Frenchtown commonly called ""The Beaches"".  The physical area stretches from the property where the Fermi III nuclear power plant is to just south of Sterling State Park. A map is attached which outlines most of the Resort Authority Area.  This map was drawn up for the installation of new seawalls around the entire area to protect ""infrastructure"" the RDA has done for the past 20+ years.  It was created due to the tremondous need to replace infrastructure destroyed in numerous flooding situations in the 1970's.  At that time, everything was private - roads, parks, everything.  The roads in the subdivision was never built for heavy traffice and do not meet regular cost for roads.  They weren't paved, there was no central water or sewage, each subdivision (Association) had to pay for their own garbage pick-up, street lighting, road maintenance, canal and bridge maintenance.  The housing stock was primarily 1920-1940 and the homes were mostly built for summer living only.  After the floods, many homes were condemned and torn down, rental housing became prevalent and the area generally went downhill.  With the RDA created, road maintenance, street lighting, drain maintenance became their responsibility and was greatly upgraded.  Generally, the quality of life has gone up.  The RDA also provides funding to the Monroe County Sheriff for patrols specific to the beach areas.  We are in Frenchtown which, is somewhat developed - is still primarily a farming community outside the ""Beaches"".  The Township's priorities are builting a commercial strip miles away from the ""Beaches"" and maintain the farming atmosphere of the remaining area of the township.   Our area is environmentally impacted by the polluting of Lake Erie from primarily the Maumee River in Ohio.  The algae blooms have cut off water to parts of Monroe County.  Our water comes via a pipe a mile off the shore of ""the Farms"" which is the beach association next to us.  The water has to be treated with more and more chemicals in order to make sure the toxins in the algae do not harm us.  The air pollution has been reduced since DTE was forced by the EPA to be ""scrubbers"" on the Monroe Power Plant.  This is a coal-burning plant - the biggest in southeast Michigan, and has the dubious distinction of providing over 90% of the acid rain over southwest Ontario.  We could sit and watch the orange plumes waif across the water towards Canada.  The Fermi II is next door to us and the area is still storing all of the used uranium fuel since Fermi I was built in the 1950's - all of it being stored on that property on the shore of Lake Erie.  I think it's of utmost importance that our community be tied to the downriver communities that also rim Lake Erie and the Detroit River.  The amount of coal-powered power plants in Trenton, Wyandotte, and River Rouge and the pollution in the river and the lake - join us at the hip.  We are one big community of interest and with climate change upon us, we need representation in the State and Federal government."
472,coi,,"lenawee,monroe,communityofinterest,congressionalmaps",Lenawee and Monroe - Don't Split Us!,"Monroe and Lenawee County are connected in multiple ways, and therefore should not be broken up in Congressional representation as a community of interest. First of all, we share a major route of commerce and transportation, M-50. This major route of transit connects the two counties to Lake Erie, the City of Jackson, and many other small communities that rely on the route for daily transportation and commerce. The two counties also share the River Raisin, a major environmental watershed that provides numerous recreational opportunities along with the obvious shared goal of preserving the natural landscape we enjoy because of the river. Another connection between Lenawee and Monroe County is the strong agricultural presence in both counties. As someone who has spent a large portion of my life in both counties, working on farms, I know firsthand how reliant these counties are upon the agricultural industry here. In our shared industries, we must be united in representation.  If, for example, Monroe County was lumped in with Wayne or Washtenaw County, we would be at the behest of the more urban communities. It makes much more sense to loop the urban communities together, as they share similar needs. But we should not share representatives.   Our counties are very similar and reliant on each other and we should be considered one community of interest. "

Much of the discharged material remains in the river sediment and in flood plains, with a result that there are extensive  restrictions on eating fish from these waters or game from adjoining areas.  As a result of multiple court actions, Dow remains involved in a large number of EPA-supervised mitigation projects."

What I mean is programs, offices, and agencies have all been aligned based on demographics to create service areas already. To divide these established and working service areas up would do a disservice to the people they serve. For example regional planning commission, the aging agency, the department of transportation, and even the governor's original coronavirus reopening plan serves Jackson, Hillsdale, Lenawee counties. So, as you can see this tri-county region relies heavily on each other for everything from roads to healthcare. I would strongly encourage you as a commission to look at the regional partnerships like the four I just named when drawing districts."

478,coi,,"arabnarratives,arabvoices,mena,wearemena,access",Arab & Middle Eastern/North African COI,"The Arab or Middle Eastern/North African (MENA) Community  As the leading Arab American community-based organization, ACCESS (ARAB COMMUNITY CENTER FOR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL SERVICES) has worked for 50 years as a service provider. The agency services 70,000 individuals from disenfranchised communities—primarily those representing the Arab American community—on an annual basis. This on-the-ground experience has allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the needs and challenges facing this critically underrepresented community. The Arab American community that ACCESS serves most directly, in metropolitan Detroit, is one of the largest and most concentrated in the nation. But the community is also unique in its diversity, successes, and challenges. In metropolitan Detroit, we have many people with Lebanese, Iraqi, Yemeni, Syrian, Palestinian, and Egyptian ancestry. There are also smaller communities of people from Sudan, Morocco, and Algeria. The community is one of the oldest Arab American communities, with roots back to the 1890s, and receives more Arabic-speaking refugees and immigrants than almost any other metro area in the country.   The U.S. Census counts people who hold Arab ancestry or other Middle Eastern or North African (MENA) origins within the ""White"" racial category. The truth is, Arab/MENA Americans have distinct issues, and experiences and national-level data on Arab/MENA Americans obscure regional variations, such as disadvantaged communities in the Metro Detroit area. Nationally, among Arabs living in the U.S., 75% live in multigenerational households, and 78% are U.S Citizens (Native-born & Naturalized). The Arab/MENA community, though lumped into the White racial category by the U.S. Census (following guidelines from the federal Office of Management and Budget), is quite distinct from the White population. The diverse Arab/MENA populations may trace their ancestry to different countries, speak different dialects or languages, practice different religions and fall into a broad range of socioeconomic categories. However, they have much more in common than any other ethnic or racial group. Using the best available data from the U.S. Census' American Community Survey (ACS), a report was created by ACCESS demonstrating that a picture of a unique community emerges as a result of disaggregating the Arab/MENA community from the White racial category. For instance, the socioeconomic characteristics by Ancestry and Location using ACS 5-Year Estimates (2010-2014, Weighted) indicate that 43% of the Arab/MENA community (ages 25-64) live in poverty 8.4% are unemployed. Moreover, the most recent issue of the ACCESS Health Journal, published in 2018, identifies: ""a growing body of research"" indicating ""that Arab Americans,"" particularly refugees, ""are subject to a host of stressors, including discrimination, lack of social support, and economic hardship that could detrimentally influence their mental health,"" but which are under-emphasized due current data.   Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb:   Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb counties are the three most populous counties in Michigan and comprise metro Detroit. These three counties also have the most significant Arab/MENA populations in the state and some of the most concentrated Arab and Iraqi Chaldean populations in the nation.    Dearborn and Dearborn Heights   Dearborn and Dearborn Heights have many commonalities, including history, culture, heritage, and ancestry. Many community members who live in Dearborn Heights, for example, either have family connections to Dearborn, work in the City of Dearborn. As one of our Volunteers, Sara stated on June 3rd, some even attend schools, not within their district. The current district maps divide Dearborn Heights and Dearborn in the middle. This divide is manifested in both the Senate and House maps for Dearborn Heights, further marginalizing the Arab/MENA community, impacting available resources, and making the right to vote for representatives that reflect their shared needs, concerns, & culture almost impossible. The Arab/MENA population in these areas has grown significantly over the last 20 years. Today the South end of Dearborn, where ACCESS' main branch is, has a high concentration of Arab/MENA residents (many of which are new immigrants & Refugees). Below are some data about the Arab population for 48120 zip code (which encompasses the south end and a wealthier section of Dearborn called Spring wells Park. In 2000, according to the Census, 48120 was 49% Arab ancestry. According to 2015-2019 ACS, 48120 had 52% Arab. The growth of Arabs in the south end may not have changed much. However, it is the rest of Dearborn where one can see the change and growth:   * In 1990, Dearborn was 15% Arab.  * In 2000, Dearborn was 30% Arab.  * In 2019, Dearborn was 47% Arab.     Drawing from the ACS Estimates (2015-2019), approximately 41.7% of the eastern side of Dearborn residents (Zip Code 48126) were foreign-born. 68.4% of those foreign-born were naturalized U.S. citizens, and an estimated 72.3% entered the country before 2010. The ACS data shows that 91.6% of foreign-born came from Asia, yet when asked about race only. The Arab/MENA population has tripled in 30 years and will continue to grow - albeit being undercounted.    Melvindale  Melvindale is part of the Arab/MENA community of Interest, isolated from the rest of the community in Dearborn and Dearborn Heights. ACCESS' youth and education program currently serves the community in Melvindale. It has Arab/MENA immigrant students, parents, and community members who share experiences with the rest of the MENA/Arab COI (Communities of Interest).   The Melvindale-Northern Allen Park Public Schools  The Melvindale-Northern Allen Park Public Schools is a suburb of the City of Detroit. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 2.76 square miles. The 2017 population (estimate) of the City of Melvindale was 10,322, with 24.7% of the population under the age of 18. Recent data indicates that the student population has increased in terms of cultural diversity in the past seven years. The student population consists of 0.3% American Indian or Alaska Native, 0.6% Asian, 8.5% African American, 26.2% Hispanic, and 64.4% Caucasian (this figure does not accurately include the large Arab or Middle Eastern students).   ACCESS' 21st Century Community Learning Centers reflect the demographics in the 2020/2021 School Year:  The total number of enrolled students in cities between Dearborn, Dearborn Heights, Redford, River Rouge, Melvindale, Allen Park, and Detroit is 940. Around 583 students were Arab (62%). In Melvindale (Zip Code 48122), the total number of students enrolled in the 21st-century community learning center was 151, of which 130 are Arab/MENA (86%). In Dearborn (Zip Code 48126), the total number of students enrolled in the same learning center was 291, where 280 are Arab/MENA (96%). In the South end of Dearborn (Zip Code 48120), the number of enrolled students is 95, of which 94 are Arab/MENA (99%).    The current Senate maps include Melvindale, but the House maps cut the community in the middle. The community in Melvindale has more commonalities and shared history and trauma with the cities of Dearborn and Dearborn Heights rather than Lincoln Park. The congressional map is not very different as it cuts Melvindale into another district away from their Arab/MENA community. Dearborn's congressional map places the city with cities like Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti, which have entirely different COIs with different socioeconomic backgrounds, experiences, educational levels, and needs. There is also part of west Detroit where a significant Arab/MENA population resides and whom ACCESS' serves. Since the Detroit metro area receives such a high number of refugees and recent immigrants from Arab countries, Arab Americans in Detroit are more likely to be impoverished and have a lower level of educational attainment than Arab Americans in other metro regions.    The truth is, we may not be able to draw perfect lines and maps. Yet, we can ensure that communities of Interest, especially historically underrepresented communities, are not divided because of partisan lines. We urge the commission to make sure that our Community of Interest, the Arab/MENA community, which has contributed to the civic, political, and economic life of the Metro Detroit area, is connected. This social justice lens is the only way our community can feel represented and included in the political process. "
479,coi,,,Lakefront Suburbs,"The suburbs along Lake St. Clair should be together because of common interests.  Residents enjoy lakefront parks and recreation.    Non-lakefront communities literally dump sewage into our water.  Look it up.  Millions of gallons of sewage come from as far away as Oakland County and flow into our lake.  This is especially a problem when there are heavy rains.    If we are split up into different districts, no one will look out for us and fight for solutions.  People that don't live in lakefront communities don't face the same impact from sewage being dumped in our water.  Our lakefront suburbs need to stick together to fight for solutions and districts lines should be drawn to keep us all together."

We could and should all be included in a single state senate district and a single congressional district so that we will have common representation.  In contrast, if we are split across multiple districts, each of which is dominated by inland cities, our specific lakefront issues will continue to be ignored.  "

As a community of interest, downriver has traditionally shared not only recreation, schools, churches, and community events but also police and emergency support through the Downriver Mutual Aid agreement that pairs local police, SWAT, hazardous spill responses and other emergency services among communities for over 40 years. We share the waterfront and access to boating, kayaking, local rowing teams and share concerns about the development of the waterfront as well (specifically the development of the former McLouth Steel toxic/polluted site which is currently being cleaned up but who's future may bring more undesirable heavy industry to the area.) When companies wanted to store giant piles of Pet Coke which was dangerous to all who lived nearby, communities worked together to oppose it. The communities commonly referred to as downriver are attached in an upload here on a map and are Allen Park Brownstown Township Ecorse Flat Rock Gibraltar Grosse Ile Township Huron Charter Township New Boston Waltz Willow Lincoln Park Melvindale River Rouge Riverview Rockwood Romulus Southgate Taylor Trenton Woodhaven Wyandotte Geographic proximity are a given as evidenced by the attached map but the history of community support and shared interests and concerns also makes us a community of interest. We dine, work and travel between our local communities on a daily basis. My husband and I personally live on Grosse Ile, own a business in Lincoln Park, a rental home in Wyandotte and dine in 6 or 7 of the local communities on a regular basis. What happens in one community directly affects another. The ""free"" county bridge that allows access to Grosse Ile near Trenton has been closed for over a year for repairs which has hurt businesses big and small in Trenton and on Grosse Ile. Local hospital traffic has all been rerouted to Wyandotte which affects not only the Wyandotte hospital but the hospital in Trenton who now gets less business because of the closure. Grosse Ile is tiny community of 5,000 homes and about 10,000 people and we rely heavily on our neighbors for many services including the Mutual Aid/Rescue mentioned above. I'm truly not aware of the population limits on districts but Downriver should be kept together as much as possible.

The main economic activities are manufacturing, retail, and healthcare. Many people commute to Ann Arbor or to Jackson for work.  The purpose of this submission is to demonstrate that land use and economic activity in Northwest Washtenaw is not  primarily agricultural -- ~37,000 acres in the shaded region are the city of Chelsea, state recreational areas, and an automotive proving grounds facility.

513,coi,,,Southwestern-most/Lakefront Senate Distr,"Due to our unique seasonal, environmental, topographical, and economic issues (chiefly related to tourism, water levels and erosion), I am primarily interested in creating a lakefront district as the southwestern-most senate district, starting with all of Berrien County, and moving up through part of Van Buren County, part of Allegan County, and including the greater Holland area. I'm proposing a similar triangle to Berrien County, but extending farther up the coast. If you connect my dots, they simply represent the approximate outermost district lines I'm proposing.  Here are my original public comments, delivered in person at one of the public hearings and online:  Hello. My name is Kim Jorgensen Gane. My husband and I have raised two generations of kids in St. Joseph in Berrien County. I’ve been a restaurateur, a realtor, I ran communications for Chokwe Pitchford—a very compelling then 21-year-old Black man who ran for the 79th state house district in 2020. I’m also a citizen appointee to the sustainability committee for the City of St. Joe. I, too, want to thank the commission and say to you, “Obiwan Kinobi, you are our only hope.”   It’s no accident that current maps lump Berrien County with two ultra white rural counties with which we have little in common. This hurts them, too, as we’ve heard today, and it hurts the sustainability of our region, especially our lakeshore communities impacted by extreme climate events, resulting erosion, and a seasonal economy related to the ups & downs of tourism, but lacking many of the state and federal supports available to agricultural communities.   We face routine frustration that much of our district is so heavily influenced, socially and politically, by northwest Indiana media. I want my representatives to understand and support my and my community’s Michigan interests & concerns.  But mostly, I’m troubled that current maps make my district overwhelmingly white and heteronormative. We’ve worked for years to ensure that LGBTQ Michiganders are included in Michigan’s Elliott Larsen civil rights protections.   It makes good sense for racially and socially diverse communities like Niles and St. Joe/Benton Harbor in Berrien County, and South Haven and Paw Paw in Van Buren County to be in the same district to allow voters of color and LGBTQ communities to finally have a fair shot at representation. Because listening to them, considering their experience and ideas, too, will make our whole state work better for hardworking families and individuals. (Or, alternatively, as I’ve drawn here (with great difficulty using the drawing tool), including the greater Holland area in a southwestern-most lakefront district.)  What impacts our communities, impacts our counties, impacts our region, impacts our state. It’s 2021, for goodness sakes. If a global pandemic, a test insurrection at our own state capitol, a kidnapping plot against our Governor, and a long needed racial reckoning has taught us anything, at a minimum, we should all be able to agree that women and people of color and those in the LGBTQ community Are, in fact, People, too.   By design, we can’t ever hope to achieve or retain those most basic of rights for all with our current gerrymandered districts. "

Historically, residents have identified 8 mile road as a southern dividing line; hills topography, and lack of multiple significant roadways (apart from M-59) have further isolated Macomb County from Oakland County.  Additionally, the county has created a County Executive, which not every county has and which further reinforces the notion of a single governing entity.  As a lifelong resident of Macomb County I have never even visited Bad Axe, Sandusky, Bay City or Saginaw, nor do I know anyone who commutes daily between this region and Macomb County.  The ""thumb"" region of the state seems , therefore, to be significantly distinct from Macomb County.  It, therefore, makes no sense to me that northern Macomb County is included in the same congressional district as the thumb, while southern Macomb county is in a separate district that is together with parts of Oakland County.  Further, the shape of the congressional district for southern Macomb County is clearly Gerrymandered, as it is unusual in shape and that shape does not even follow an obvious transportation corridor.  Macomb County should, therefore, be part of a single congressional district."

My name is Cary Fleischer. I live in East Grand Rapids and moved here from Chicago 5 years ago. I am here today on my own behalf and on behalf of my Jewish faith based organization, Temple  Emanuel which is located in Grand Rapids. In the last 5 years I have involved myself in many community activities and organizations. I have made friends in my community of Grand Rapids, East Grand Rapids, Wyoming, Granville, Kentwood and Grand Rapids Township. I visit my friends throughout these communities. They are members of my Jewish community. These areas contain members of my reading groups. I shop in these 6 areas. I attend interfaith activities throughout these 6 communities.       For 5 years I have defined my community as these 6 contiguous  areas or cities. I don’t know the borders of one town or the next. I do know this is my community.  and East Grand Rapids, Grand Rapids, Grand Rapids Township and Wyoming and Granville and Kentwood should be kept together with shared representation.  I live in East Grand Rapids.  My car is repaired in Granville. I shop in Kentwood and Wyoming.  My Rabbi is  in GR township. I spend most of my time in Grand Rapids.          I admit  I don’t know much about maps and boundaries and redistricting and house or senate districts.       I am very happy with my move from Chicago to my new community. However, I have also learned about gerrymandering.  I admit I identify as a Democrat. When time comes for elections, I am shown maps that look like snakes and individual fingers rather than the palm of my hand. It is only at election time that because of gerrymandered boundaries, I am introduced to foreign names and areas. It is only because of politics and canvassing  that I am asked to leave my community and travel to places like Battle Creek and Greenville and Calhoun and Ionia,and  Barry.I  find it is  only at election time that these places are part of my community and only because  my state and federal,districts include these areas. I admit they are beautiful areas. Kind of like going on vacation to go to see these areas that I only visit at election time.     So here is my point. I want to continue to visit these nice places when I want a change in my community and a visit into another world. But for purposes of political maps and my community,  Let’s use some common sense and recognize Battle Creek has a great cereal festival but that is not where my community eats breakfast. So I suggest I will visit Battle Creek and Greenville and Calhoun and Ionia and Barry and get out my car navigator to find them.  But then I will return to my community of Grand Rapids and Kentwood and Wyoming and Granville and East Grand Rapids.  And just  tell my friends how wonderful the community outside is to visit.   Thank you for listening.  "

My Great Grandfather from Germany settled on the southern edge of Palmyra Township in Lenawee where a road is named after the family. My Grandfather established a farm operation in Raisin Township on the border of Raisin and Palmyra Township in Lenawee County. My father with my grandfather established his farm in Palmyra Township on the same Raisin Township border. As a 76 year old life time farmer, I now continue the farming operation my grandfather and father began plus expanding this operation on my own. As you can see I have a great passion for agriculture in Lenawee County and the community I live in. My farming operation does business with agricultural concerns and businesses in Lenawee and surrounding counties such as Monroe and Hillsdale counties. These businesses are seed, fertilizer, and chemical businesses as well as machinery dealerships, machine shops, and welding and fabricating companies. I also rub shoulders with many farmers and ag related business people throughout this tri county area. I am a member of the Lenawee Farm Bureau and participate in activities at the Lenawee County Fair. It makes sense to me that the people in government share my interests and have an understanding of the agricultural world I live in, whether it be my State Representative, my State Senator or my US Congressman. Therefore, I am asking that my concerns are at the top of your list when drawing up districts for all three public offices. I do not believe the interests of large urban communities would be sensitive to the needs of agriculture and the rural areas. I am well aware that agriculture is and has been one of Michigan's leading industries and has played a huge part in making Michigan great.MR"

I have worked 43 years in education teaching English, Spanish, and English as a Second Language. In my career the partnerships between individual schools districts and the county intermediate schools districts are invaluable. Individual districts and the county ISD rely on each other for in-service resources and workshops, curriculum direction, a substitute teacher system, a shared calendar, transportation, libraries, etc. Representatives may speak or participate in school events, which are then featured in our shared newspaper—Gateway Media—which produces the Daily Telegram and Monroe News (covering Lenawee, Hillsdale, and Monroe counties). Having shared school and sports news with neighboring counties has been unifying, as well as a source of ideas to share. These services and common experiences unite our county in a way that forms an education community of interest where many the above resources are shared. This is more economical and also creates unity. In addition to these intra-county connections, the Lenawee ISD and school districts here sometimes partner with Hillsdale and Jackson counties, and their four-year colleges and community colleges. Keeping our area connected is important to allow us to be able to effectively meet the needs of school districts, partner with local colleges, and have a united voice to speak to our elected officials. It has created a sense of community to have common representation with our county and among neighboring counties."

Our community, Lenawee County, best understands the basic needs and growth of our citizens and therefore, should remain whole.

These organizations include, but are not limited to: Food Pantries, Animal Rescue Services, Pregnancy Care Centers, Homeless Shelters, Child Advocacy Centers, Veterans Groups, Rehabilitation Services, the Arts, Domestic Violence Centers, Youth Organizations, Housing Help and People with Disabilities. Every single one of these non-profit organizations is essential to our community which is Lenawee County. We all work together by volunteering and donating to keep these organizations running for the citizens who need them to survive. It is imperative that Lenawee County remain intact to keep our non-profit community thriving. We do not want to encounter conflicting interests competing for basic needs and services for the community if we were to be divided.

Businesses in border counties are affected by tax and business policies established In Lansing and Washington D.C., which are different from non-border counties. When we’ve had a divided representation our representatives often don’t really understand our issues or speak with our voice. They are often more divided in their focus and in their accountability to us. When we border counties/areas can be united, it has helped us have a stronger voice for our specific concerns. Our representatives have lived and experienced the special challenges that we face when we have to compete with Ohio and Indiana. Some recurring examples are when gas, cigarette, and alcohol taxes are raised. I see a big effect on my clients who are then at a major disadvantage with businesses in the states to the south of us. Splintering our voice and our representation would discriminate against us, be less efficient, and be overall more costly and less productive.

We all benefit and rely on surrounding communities, thus we should be voting as a single block.  The current system is broken as it disenfranchises many residents by assuming residents in Flint have the same needs and community interests as those in Tawas City or residents in Cadillac have similar community interests and needs as folks in Frankenmuth.  Perhaps more importantly, and not designed by intention, the demographics of this district mirror the state very well."

Downtown Farmington is in effect the Downtown of Farmington Hills. We should be a contiguous unit when it comes to State and National representation as our issues are the same  and we also  share civic organizations such as the Farmington Musicale, Farmington Community  Arts Council  and Farmington Historical Society which my wife has been  very active in. Being close to West Bloomfield and Franklin Village and having relationships with people and businesses in those areas makes them from my perspective part of my community of interest.

664,coi,,,Woodward Corridor Communities,"The Woodward Corridor is composed of multiple older, inner-ring suburban communities that were split mostly from the former Royal Oak Township in the early-mid 20th Century; however,  if the communities of the former township were not fractured during their establishment in the early 20th century, and still one municipality such as Livonia, Sterling Heights, or Troy, it would be the second largest city in the state with close to 215,000 people living across the 10 cites and 1 township. The population density of this area is over 5,000 people per square mile, which is incredibly high by Michigan standards, higher than the current density of the City of Detroit, and about 2 to 2.5x the density of a typical Metro Detroit suburb. The communities all have very walkable corridors, neighborhood pocket parks, and small downtown districts. Many of these small suburbs already share school districts, city services, and community amenities.   These communities should be considered a single area of interest because there are significant cultural similarities across the suburban communities. There are many policy topics they have mutual interest in, such as infrastructure investment, urban planning, and redevelopment interests. These communities would be best served by having shared representation at the state and federal levels."

That school system's identity ties together the diverse voices of the area and allows people to find their first ""home.""

Why would the commission split the watershed? The environmental connection of the Watershed and the River Raisin is one that is prevalent in our communities. As a duck hunter, the Watershed is very important to my way of life. Much of my free time is spent enjoying the natural beauty of the River Raisin. I also fish frequently in the River or the streams connected to the River Raisin. Many of my neighbors live, work, and play in the Watershed as well. Specific watersheds have individual needs and likewise should have specific representatives. Combining the Huron River Watershed with the River Raisin watershed would be a horrible mistake. For example, the Huron Watershed has its own challenges, such as urban pollution, runoff from roads, etc, whereas the River Raisin Watershed has more challenges associated with agricultural runoff. These watersheds should have their own state and federal representatives because these different challenges should be on the front of their minds maintaining the watershed, not trying to balance the two."

701,other,,,Michigan AFL-CIO Fair Maps Project,"Honorable Commissioners:    On behalf of our one million active and retired members across the state of Michigan, I humbly submit for your review the current progress on our Fair Maps Project - an effort undertaken by the Michigan AFL-CIO over the past seven months to survey union members and their communities in an effort to provide insight on the MICRC’s redistricting process.    The attached maps of proposed state House and Senate districts, and an extensive analysis disclosing details about the process (including background about each district and objective measurements of fairness and other criteria) are a result of the efforts of our Fair Maps Project.    The maps, and our 237 page analysis, can all be viewed at miaflcio.org/fairmaps   We believe these districts accurately reflect the diversity and distribution of Michigan's population and communities of interest, comply with the state's constitution and the Voting Rights Act, follow equal population requirements, are contiguous, do not favor or disfavor any political party or incumbent elected officials or candidates, reflect county, city and township boundaries, and are compact.    As the voluntary state labor federation, the Michigan AFL-CIO’s most vital role is to lift up and reflect the voices of our over 1 million active and retired members, and to fight for not only our members but all working people across the state of Michigan. We are incredibly proud of the exhaustive process we undertook to solicit feedback on communities of interest and local gerrymanders, and the final result of all this work.    These maps and districts are a reflection of the intent of the Michigan Constitution as it was drafted and as it has been amended: that all political power should be inherent in the people, and that our state government should be instituted for their equal benefit, security and protection.    As you know, too often over the last six decades, our government has failed to live up to these aspirations. It is our hope that the Independent Citizens' Redistricting Commission will carefully consider our draft maps, and heed what we've proven here: that it is possible to draw 148 districts that comply with the objective criteria laid out by Proposal 2018-2, as well as the principles of self-determination, fairness, and justice for all that our country and state were founded to follow and uphold.   Over the last several months we held meetings with our 18 labor councils, our 40+ affiliates, as well as local labor leaders and activists to solicit information on their communities of interest, their views on the deficiencies of the current maps, and what fair maps in their region can and should look like.    As public hearings and written comments went on, we listened to and read the same testimony as the Commission, incorporating organic grassroots testimony but disregarding clearly orchestrated attempts to lobby the Commission in favor of a party or candidate or special interest group. Finally, we conducted objective, independent research on Michigan’s economic and cultural geography - everything from commuter patterns, agricultural regions, and objective economic data to local community organizations and recent census estimates.    Here is what our efforts have produced, by chamber:   State House   Our state House map has 12 majority-Black districts, an additional two majority-POC districts (including one that includes all of Southwest Detroit), and an additional two districts with a high concentration of Arab-Americans - who are considered White by the Census but are an important community of interest.  Our state House map is highly competitive and would be very likely to deliver a majority of seats to the party that wins the majority of votes.  In analyzing the House map, we found that 56 of the districts are more Republican than the statewide average, and 54 of the districts are more Democratic than the statewide average.  According to various academic measures of partisan fairness, our state House map has a small bias toward the Republican Party.  We have made the following background data about our maps publicly available at www.miaflcio.org/fairmaps: a statistical overview, a district-by-district breakdown, and detailed data for partisan fairness, compactness, and demographics & election results in each district and in the state as a whole.   State Senate   Our state Senate map has 5 majority-Black districts and an additional district in Genesee County that would be over one-third POC.  Our state Senate map is highly competitive and would be very likely to deliver a majority of seats to the party that wins the majority of votes.  In a comparable analysis to the House, but this time based on the 2018 Attorney General election (the closest major statewide election concurrent with the most recent state Senate elections), we examined the state Senate districts and found that 19 of the districts are more Republican than the statewide average, while 19 are more Democratic than the statewide average.  According to various academic measures of partisan fairness, our state Senate map has an extremely small bias toward the Republican Party.  We have made the following background data about our maps publicly available at www.miaflcio.org/fairmaps: a statistical overview, a district-by-district breakdown, and detailed data for partisan fairness, compactness, and demographics & election results in each district and in the state as a whole.   As our membership is composed of people of all political persuasions, we continue to remain staunchly opposed to either party’s attempts - either Democrat or Republican - to unfairly and unjustly influence the redistricting process.    As a nonpartisan organization, we hope that these maps and the analysis provided can help to show the Commission, and the general public, that we believe this is an opportunity for us to truly put people over politics and fight for truly fair maps. Michigan working families deserve no less.   I thank you for your consideration and for your dedicated service to our state.   In Solidarity,   Ron Bieber President, Michigan AFL-CIO"
702,other,,,Ethan Smith's Redistricting Plan 8/2/21,"Most districts are made of complete counties, which is how districts should be.  I rarely split up counties.  I'll describe some reasons why this map is fair.  This map keeps the tri-city area together, doesn't split up Kent County, and is VRA compliant with 2 majority minority districts in Detroit.  It also keeps the Lansing area in one district, keeps Kalamazoo with the rest of South-Western Michigan, and creates a clean suburban Oakland County district.  I also made sure the thumb stayed together.  District 13 was a challenge, but Livingston County is in a difficult position surrounded by areas that are so politically and culturally different, so I connected it with the thumb.  This map would likely produce a 7 Republican to 6 Democrat (or vice versa) congressional delegation as long as the state remains a political battleground.  "

I’m a political science major at Michigan and have studied redistricting. I’ve drawn a full state house district map for Kent County. The advantage is that it includes seven districts that are entirely within Kent County and that don’t include areas outside Kent County. It also has very few breaks between municipalities and keeps together key communities of interest.  Sorry, I drew my map in Dave’s and don’t know how to remake it in redistrictr.   1. Blue: I started by trying to create the most Person of Color district possible in Grand Rapids. I focused on Ward 3 and used Fulton as the dividing line because that’s the key dividing line in our address quadrant system.   2. Green: Is northern Grand Rapids (mostly Ward 2) and the Westside of GR. Obviously, Grand Rapids is its own community of interest.  3. Purple: Next I went to the next largest city, Wyoming and created a Wyoming-Grandville district. They are neighboring cities and the population works out almost perfectly, so it helps with minimizing breaks.   4. Next, I went to the third largest city, Kentwood and put it together with the extra GR districts (the ones south of 28th street) and the other nearby city: East GR. That kept two neighboring cities together. The population wasn’t enough, so I added Grand Rapids Township. It’s where I live so I know it well. While it’s a township and not a city, it looks more like Kentwood and EGR than any other neighboring township (it’s all commercial and residential, I don’t think there are any farms there anymore, except for Robinnettes).   5. Yellow: Walker was the left-over metro city, so I added it to nearby areas like Rockford, Sparta and Plainfield. They overlap some school districts, and are white working-class areas.   6. Teal: Then I drew two maps with lots of farms so agricultural interests are represented. The Teal district includes fruit and crop farms in northern and eastern Kent. Ada is a small town surrounded by suburban developments and farms. I didn’t like splitting Ada and Cascade since they’re pretty similar, but I had to make the populations work. Also, I had to separate the city of Lowell from Lowell Township, but again, I had to watch my population.   7. Peach: What’s left matches up well. It’s the lower row of townships that are south of M-6, Lowell Township and Cascade township.   So, I think it’s a strong map. It keeps all the Representatives in Kent County, which means they can focus on the interests of the fourth largest county in Michigan as well as their local areas. It has no municipal precinct breaks other than the required extra precincts in Grand Rapids left over after you draw two districts. I hope you’ll use it!"

718,other,,state house,Michigan House Map Proposal,"Linked is my proposal for the Michigan State House, which is the culmination of several months of research and plain simple trial and error. As far as I can tell, this map satisfactorily complies with all requirements for Michigan's Legislative redistricting, and I frankly believe that there are not many ways this map could be improved, barring input from certain community of interests I may not be aware of in the Upper Peninsula and Central Michigan.  This map contains all 110 districts of the Michigan House, of appropriate population.   From a Macro-level partisan-fairness standpoint, I believe this map successfully balances Communities of Interest, fairness, competitiveness (which while not a listed criteria has been noted as an important area of concern by many individuals offering testimony at the public comment hearings), and reasonable compactness. Looking at a partisan breakdown of a map, recent statewide elections would result in the following results under this map (statewide popular vote winners placed at top regardless of number of seats carried):  2016 Presidential: D. Trump (R)- 66 H. Clinton (D)- 44  2018 Michigan Attorney General: D. Nessel (D)- 53 T. Leonard (R)- 57  2018 Gubernatorial: G. Whitmer (D)- 63 B. Schuette (R)- 47  2020 Presidential: J. Biden (D)- 55 D. Trump (R)- 55  2020 U.S. Senate: G. Peters (D)- 54 J. James (R)- 56    In the 2020 Presidential Election, there were 24 districts (21.8% of total districts) which voted for a candidate by less than ten percentage points. In the 2020 Senate race, there were 27 (24.5% of total districts) which voted for a candidate by less than ten percentage points. Under the current map, there were 22 districts (20% of total districts) which voted for a candidate by less than ten percentage points in both the Presidential and Senate races.   Additionally, there are multiple crossover districts which backed Democratic Statewide and Republican Statewide candidates between cycles and sometimes in the same election year. Two districts voted for Donald Trump (R) in 2020, while simultaneously backing Gary Peters (D) for Senate. At the same time, three districts supported Joe Biden (D) for President while backing John James (R) for Senate. Under the current map, there were only two districts which backed statewide candidates off opposite parties, both of which supported Biden (D) for President, while simultaneously voting for James (R) in the Senate race.   While it is clear that this map still does slightly advantage Republicans relative to their statewide numbers, the geography of Michigan makes a perfectly proportional map nearly impossible without breaking up mid-sized cities, and I don't don't know the regions where that would be done well enough to determine whether that would make sense from a Communities of Interest standpoint, so I followed municipal lines when in doubt.

719,other,,,Trenton's State House Districts Plan,"Hello again commissioners, I'm Trenton Berry and my community of interest is Midland and the county itself. The link provided gives a general layout of the State House districts could look like in which they are fair for each party. Before I start my explanation, I would like to give credit to Ian Sandler-Bowen in which I used his layout of the districts in Oakland and Macomb counties as well as the Thumb region, I used his layout for the simple fact that he is from around the area and knows better in which communities are closely linked than I do. Within this map many of the house districts are more compact in which they have more in common with each other than the previous map. Based on the 2016 Presidential numbers, Republicans would have won 60 seats compared to the Democrats 50 seats. Based on the 2018 Governor numbers, Democrats would have won 62 seats compared to the Republicans 48 seats. These results would allow for both parties to win the State House rather than just one party winning it even if they didn't win the popular vote. There are 23 seats in which the winner of the seat won by less than 10% margin of their opponent, which means there are many chances for both parties to flip these seats and have control over the State House. There are still flaws with this map as well, in which communities of interests might not have been meet up to certain standards as well as still some right leaning bias due to how highly condensed Democratic areas and sparsely distributed Republican areas are which makes it easier to have more Republican seats compared to Democratic seats. I feel that this map is a good start in which the commission could use to make for political fairness while also possibly fixing the communities of interests that might not be presented within this map."

Additionally, I divided Oak Park so that the heavily Jewish Northern part is kept with Huntington Woods and Berkley, as they share a school district, part of it went with Southfield, and part of it went to a Southeast Oakland district for the purposes of population equality. I also split off Downtown Royal Oak and put it with the district containing Ferndale, as both vibrant downtowns would have similar infrastructure concerns which a state legislator can advocate for. There are two Majority Minority districts. From a partisan standpoint, there are seven Democratic leaning districts, three highly competitive districts, and four that strongly would favor Republicans. This is reasonably reflective of the County as a whole.   For Macomb I followed municipal lines, and the districts contained within Macomb would likely result in three held by Democrats, four held by republicans, and two highly competitive districts, with the remaining population in a heavily Republican thumb district.

I have created a plan for the Michigan Senate districts this time to give equal playing field within our states legislature. There are too many to list of within this but some changes that some would appreciate is the compactness of these districts in which they are much closer to where their communities of interests are. In summary there are 15 Democrat seats and 13 Republican seats that won with 55% or higher within their district. Which leaves 10 that are less than 55% won, where 5 of those were won by a Democrat and 4 by a Republican; this left 1 district where the Democrat won by only  .08%. In total that means 21 Democrats win and 18 Republicans win, but since there are 10 possible competitive districts that leaves with both sides having a fair chance of winning the state senate. The last thing I would like to add is that there are 4 majority Minority districts within this map, there is room where I could possibly add a few more but with little knowledge about their communities of interest I will leave it at that for the time being.

733,other,,competitive,Competitive Redistricting Plan,"Having competitive districts is essential to ensuring that our democratic process works properly. Political science also shows that competition makes government more responsive to constituents, which benefits voters of all political affiliations. I have put together a map based on 2019 ACS data and 2016 presidential voting data that I think fulfills a number of tenets of fairness and reasonableness:  1. The map I have drawn retains two majority African American districts in order to comply with the Voting Rights Amendment.  2. The districts are fairly compact, scoring higher on the Reock and Polsby-Popper measures than the current map. Additionally, 72 of 83 counties are kept whole and municipalities are generally kept together (except for Detroit which has to be split in order to draw two majority minority districts and comply with the VRA). Note: The software will say District 12 is not contiguous but this is just because it is treating Grosse Ile as disconnected since it's an island.  3. The map creates six highly competitive districts. In 2016, the margin between Trump and Clinton votes in each of these six districts would have been about 3% or less. Trump would have narrowly carried 2 of these districts while Clinton would have narrowly carried the other 4. Of the remaining districts, Trump would have carried 4 solidly (by about 20-30 points), Clinton would have carried 2 very solidly (by about 50 points), and Clinton would have carried the final district comfortably (by about 7 points). This seems like a fair partisan breakdown of districts (4 solid rep, 2 solid dem, 1 lean dem, and 6 toss up) given that our state has been pretty close to 50-50 in recent statewide elections. "

737,other,,"oakland county,southfield,bloomfield township,southfield township,oak park city,southeast oakland county,state house",Southeast Oakland State House Proposal,"These districts are quite a significant departure from the current configuration, however I believe that there is a compelling argument to be made in favor of my map as opposed to one that bears a resemblance to the current districts.  The key to my proposal is splitting Southfield Township (Franklin, Bingham Farms, and Beverly Hills) from the City of Southfield. These areas are not only significantly whiter, but also wealthier than Southfield proper. This bears a much closer resemblance to Bloomfield Township and Birmingham above than it does to the Black and less affluent Southfield to their South. The median household income in Southfield proper is about $50.4k a year. In Franklin, Bingham Farms, and Beverly Hills, median income is respectively $150.3k, $113.3k, and 108.2k. If we look at Bloomfield Township and Birmingham, their median income is $112.5k and $118.3k, which are far more comparable to the Southfield Township municipalities. From a demographic standpoint as well, Franklin, Bingham Farms, and Beverly Hills are all very White, with a not insignificant Asian population. The City of Southfield  is 69.4% Black. Southfield Township is far more demographically similar: largely White, with a reasonable Asian population.  This split leads to the district encompassing Southfield and Lathrup Village to be underpopulated. To make up for this, I drew in parts of Oak Park and Royal Oak Township. This is because those areas bear striking Demographic similarities to the City of Southfield. Both are heavily Black (2019 Population Estimates place the section of Oak Park in my district at about 74.4% Black, and Royal Oak Township at 91.8% Black), and are relatively lower income than other nearby municipalities such as Huntington Woods and Ferndale. Furthermore, under other district configurations (including the present map), these heavily black communities would be represented by a White State Representative. This new configuration would allow for African American voters to actually have a fair voice in electing their State Representative, unlike under the current map which places them in a 2/3rds White district.  The other significant difference I can't as easily point to demographic or statistical differences so much as just having experienced and lived in the region my entire life. From what I've seen and experienced, Royal Oak ought to be divided into two different districts. The dividing line I propose is Gardenia/Catalpa for the North/South divide, as it seperates a Royal Oak which feels far more similar to its Southern neighbors from that which is a better fit with Berkley and Huntington Woods. The Southern, downtown-heavy region bears a striking cultural and historical similarity to Ferndale. From a cultural standpoint, both Ferndale and that section of Royal Oak have been significantly impacted by a substantial LGBTQ+ population, with a 1997 list of LGBTQ+ friendly cities listing Ferndale and Royal Oak. Ferndale also bears a noticeable similarity with its Eastern neighbor Hazel Park (in addition to Demographic and historical parallels, both are currently represented together at all levels of Government above the Municipal). Both have recovered from a state of disrepair and have (or are currently) attracting many new and educated residents. They went from being ""Hazel-tucky"" and ""Ferna-bama"" when my parents first moved to Ferndale in 1996, to both being fairly comfortably middle-class. The remainder of this district is made up by Madison Heights, which bears an economic resemblance to Hazel Park (fairly middle income), and is also culturally similar, containing the John R corridor and a border with Warren in Macomb County along Dequindre.   The final of my proposed districts, comprising Royal Oak, Clawson, Berkeley, Huntington Woods, Pleasant Ridge, and the remainder of Oak Park is the result of some Communities of Interest, as well as just being an efficient use of the remaining population. Huntington Woods and northern Oak Park both have a noticeable Jewish Population, which would be well served being maintained in a district. Pleasant Ridge is also demographically fairly similar to Huntington Woods (generally white, educated, and fairly affluent with median household incomes of over $100k. The remainder of Royal Oak and Clawson below Elmwood Avenue are added in order to allow the district to achieve the target population. This would additionally allow for an adequately populated district comprising the city of Troy and the remainder of Clawson to be drawn.   I hope that this is useful and helpful in informing the way Southern Oakland County's State House districts are drawn. "

The remaining $87,000+ went to Democrat candidates.  “The Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission was created to put an end to gerrymandering, but the AFL-CIO is asking them to cut the state into strange pieces to deliver wins for their political allies,” said Tony Daunt, Executive Director with FAIR Maps. “Voters created the commission to deliver fair maps, flatly rejecting the creation of oddly shaped districts, which were used to great effect by supporters of the 2018 amendment to Michigan’s Constitution, not to inject gerrymandering with steroids.

My US Congressional district--the 4th-- is currently so gerrymandered, it is shameful. I am so happy that the Commission will apply the rules about being as compact as possible and wanted to be sure you knew that we do have a community of interest in Midland-Bay City-Saginaw, also known as Great Lakes Bay Region, along with Flint. We share a health system, an arts community, and an airport - literally called MBS--for TriCities. Our HS sports teams compete with each other and our larger nonprofits service the tri cities collectively. We have community colleges and other educational institutions that serve these residents (Delta College, Saginaw Valley State University, Baker College, Mott Community Colleges, and Northwood University). We even call ourselves the “tri cities” for goodness sake. That’s our community of interest and that’s how the district should be drawn, to include all these folks. Our US Congressional district should encompass this Great Lakes Bay Region. Including Flint makes good sense, given the numbers, because we share many attributes and activities with Flint, including economic interests and large employers (Michigan Sugar (cooperative of 1250 farms), General Motors, Dow Chemical, and S.C Johnson), news and radio stations (WNEM, WEYI, WJRT, WSGW, WIOG, WCEN, WHNN, WKCQ),  educational institutions (Delta College, Saginaw Valley State University, Baker College, Mott Community Colleges, and Northwood University), and cultural events and sports (Dow Diamond with Great Lakes Loons, Midland Center for the Arts, Dow Event Center with Saginaw Spirit, Pig Gig, Bay City Fireworks, Delta College Planetarium, Crossroads Village, and The Whiting) that serve folks from all of these cities. These are aspects that bind together a community of interest--I want my Congressional district to include Midland, Bay City, Saginaw, and Flint.  I also want State House and State Senate Districts that keep Midland County whole. Midland County has nearly enough people to make up its own House district but currently it is sub-divided, which makes no sense and splitting the county between several districts causes financial hardship on elections as well as making campaigns more difficult and expensive for candidates. Folks in Midland County have endured significant hardship themselves recently, with the disastrous flooding in 2020 resulting in so many displaced families and lost homes. We need representation that is focused on our challenges, not divided up into many pieces. At least put all of Midland County in a single House District to provide the residents with a real voice.  Thank-you for your service on this Commission and for the important work you are doing. Sincerely, Lynn Pottenger"

749,written,,,Michigan AFL-CIO Fair Maps Project,"Dear Commissioners, I have reviewed the maps submitted by the Michigan AFL-CIO as they pertain to Livingston County. I find that the three districts that include parts of Livingston County are very logical and in keeping with the commuting and other patterns of our residents. The 42nd House District follows the community of interest that includes the  U.S. 23 corridor that connects Brighton and Ann Arbor. Many people along that corridor commute to Ann Arbor for school, jobs, health care, and more. Many others have moved in to the southern part of Livingston County from Washtenaw County and are familiar with that area so that district is a good fit. The 52nd House District also reflects the fact that residents are moving out of Washtenaw County and into southern Livingston County while continuing to work, go to school, and access health care in that county so it is a good fit as well. The 47th House District includes the mostly rural northern parts of the county which have similar interests. One township, Genoa, may be divided but the constitutional amendment adopted overwhelmingly by the public places a low priority on keeping political subdivisions whole and a higher priority on communities of interest. I would urge you to follow the constitutional requirements regarding political subdivisions. Overall, I think the entire plan for the state creates many competitive districts and will ensure that the party that receives the most votes statewide receives the most legislative seats, in contrast to the current maps where the will of the voters is thwarted by gerrymandering."

These cities share much in common--much more than Midland shares with the northern areas of the state that are currently lumped together.

""Economic Interests"" - what it that?  Union vs. non-union, auto industry vs  agriculture?  Once you start allowing setting political boundaries based on these nebulous ""Communities of Interest"" you are simply giving license to gerrymandering by the politically connected.  This is a slippery slope.  This should not even be contemplated. "

Well recognized community and activity centers in the area recognize the bond between these two communities.

The William Costick Activities Center describes itself as a “community-oriented, multi-purpose facility where citizens of all ages from Farmington Hills/Farmington and surrounding communities can enjoy a wide variety of social, recreational and cultural activities, events, programs and services .”  Clearly, Farmington Hills and Farmington are felt to be of one community.  Farmington Hills and Farmington share a school system.  The District Library has branches in Farmington and Farmington Hills which serve and are utilized by both communities, including sharing resources.  The local news sources, such as The Farmington Observer newspaper and the online forum The Patch, recognize the commonality of the communities, reporting stories that cover both Farmington and Farmington Hills.  The commonality of our two communities, Farmington and Farmington Hills,  makes the coherence of their representation logical and, in my opinion, a priority in the Redistricting process.

The current state of prison gerrymandering in Michigan leads to a false accounting of  the number of""residents"" in a rural county where one or more prisons are situated, which then falsely impacts the drawing of district lines.

Particularly concerning to me is the US congressional district. It is unacceptable large suburbs like Kentwood, Wyoming, and Grandville do not vote in the same congressional district, but Portage's outlying areas (over 60 miles away)  are in our congressional district.

769,written,,,"Same shape, same population size, please","According to data from the Pew Research Center, For many years in a row, the majority population of Michigan has not been represented by a corresponding majority of Michigan state government representatives. This is simply unacceptable. The entire point of a democratic republic is to have proportional representation among decision making government positions. Gerrymandering up until today has created disproportionate representation. This in turn has distorted Michigan law and the lives of Michigan citizens, to the detriment of most in favor of the few.  This abuse must stop. It must be corrected with fair redistricting.  For redistricting to be fair, the redistricting must take into account the totality of *all* districts, and subdivide them prioritizing number. All districts must have relatively even numbers of total eligible voters: denser population areas should have more districts; less dense population areas should have fewer, in proportion to relative population density.  Using 'community identity' as a measure for district borders risks being a misguided approach, in that it might artificially create or reinforce actual physical borders separating   such 'communities.' Self-reporting of such communities might also be distorted and represent not so much an essential committee but instead the presence of relatively sophisticated organizational efforts within a specific area. So priority cultural unity within individual districts risks doing a disservice to the concept of diversity itself, by containing it rather than encouraging it. Because diversity brings to our state strength, character, culture, and wealth, it should be encouraged rather than discouraged by the redistricting process.  So -- please aim for roughly equivalent shapes, of roughly equivalent numbers of eligible voters in each district. Borders should be drawn not due to self-reported cultural identities of those responding to your committee's outreach efforts, but more strictly drawn to evenly divide districts into roughly equivalent shapes and sizes. Try using ovals 'bubbles' surrounding areas of roughly equivalent numbers of residents, then bubbling the borders of these circles outwards until they collide. This approach might result in some individual communities being 'separated' into different districts, but if the multiple districts are roughly equivalent in shape and population, then the result will be additional and proportional cultural representation in multiple districts, rather than concentrated cultural representation in fewer districts.  Thank you for your work."

Other than the state of Michigan, I do not have a community of interest to nominate. In fact, while I recognize how people want to ensure their community voices are collectively heard, I would recommend that you don’t make meeting those requests a top priority. Trying to avoid/eliminate a manipulation of the voting map to serve any particular community or political party, even it is done with the best of intentions is the very reason the Commission was founded in the first place; to address and eliminate the harmful impact that gerrymandering has had on ensuring fair and equal weighting for every voter in Michigan. Attempting to meet the disparate desires of numerous communities of interest with another oddly arranged map could leave us in a similar situation, inviting similar criticisms and dissatisfactions. It would also make your jobs as Commissioners even more challenging. Instead, I recommend that your final map be comprised of simple shapes with North/South and East/West borders (and Great Lake shorelines), and a minimal number of corners; 4 or 6 ought to be possible. The main goal would be that each district whether for US or Michigan Senate and House seats has the same number of voters regardless of their political affiliations or particular community interests. To me, that is the only way to ensure fair and equal representation of each individual in the state of Michigan.  Thanks again for your efforts and good luck with this difficult but important challenge.  "

I identify as a gay man.  I am the founder of Unity Fund, the political action committee with bipartisan efforts focused on helping LGBTQ candidates to get elected to public offices.  Unity Fund was established in 2019 and registered with state of Michigan, our main focus is with Detroit its tri-counties – Oakland, Wayne, and Macomb.  The LGBTQ community is one of the least represented in our nation.  With approximately 5 to 6 % of the population LGBTQ holds under 0.1% of elected official positions nationwide.  The LGBTQ is a special interest community that requires a fair representation.    Southeast Oakland County without a doubt is the LGBTQ community of interest.  With the highest LGBTQ population in the state our area is home for many openly LGBTQ elected officials.  In Southfield – Mayor Kenson J. Siver, council person Jason Hoskins, Southfield Public Schools' Board Member Amani Johnson.  In Ferndale – council person Gregory Pawlica.  In Pleasant Ridge – commissioner Bret Scott.  In Hazel Park – council persons Mike McFall and Luke Londo. In Huntington Woods - Joe Rozell.  Many cities in the area are governed by LGBTQ or LGBTQ friendly elected officials, creating a sanctuary for the LGBTQ populace by introducing pro-LGBTQ resolutions and ordinances.  The area is home for many openly LGBTQ business owners, accommodating the LGBTQ customer base.  The area is home for many LGBTQ community organizations that provide vital resources to LGBTQ population statewide, including our youth and seniors.    These communities are currently represented by Senator Jeremy Allen Moss, who is the first and currently is the only LGBTQ person in the State Senate.  When Senator Moss was elected our voices were heard in the State Senate for the first time.  Senator Jeremy Allen Moss is a strong proponent of the Elliot – Larsen amendment that would extend the civil rights protection onto the LGBTQ community in Michigan.  Currently Elliot-Larsen Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, height, weight, familial status, or marital status but does not include any protection for the LGBTQ community.  And for the first time Senator Moss worked to make sure that the Senate recognized month of July as LGBTQ Pride Month.  Having these communities of interest in one legislative district ensures our representation because we were able to vote for candidates within our communities, and we also hope to vote for these candidates again in the future.  In summary – our community believes that Southfield, Oak Park, Huntington Woods, Ferndale, Hazel Park should remain as communities of interest in the State Senate district.   Thank you for your consideration,  Oscar Renautt  "

Yet, we have a rabid ANTI-SEMITE in a position of power within the redistricting commission - Rebecca Szetela.  Members of the Commission are entrusted with protecting minority voting rights, including the rights of Jews in Michigan, yet Commissioner Szetela has a history of racism and anti-Semitism. In a court case, which was reported on by numerous outlets in Michigan and national news, Rebecca Szetela (then Rebecca Kesler) was taken to court after winning 50 thousand dollars on ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"" and refusing to pay a friend she promised to split the winnings on. When she was forced to pay a fee to her friend, whom she cheated out of thousands of dollars, she used an anti-Semitic slur. She went to great lengths to avoid paying the money she promised, including lying about her assets. She used the anti-Semitic slur in sending a money order to her friend she was slighting out of his fair share of the winnings (I will link at the bottom of the page): ""On Aug. 27, 2010, Kesler made out a Cash Connection money order for $250 to Hirsch and his attorney David W. Williams and included “Fujb” written in the memo line, which Hirsch contends means “F*** you, Jewish bastard.” Is this appropriate for a state employee, let alone a public official entrusted with protecting minority rights? We all know the answer is no. Yet somehow she is still serving on the commission. Szetela denied that this was an anti-Semitic slur, but the judge in the case was quoted as saying her explanation ""made no sense"" and he thought ""it may very well have been an anti-Semitic racial slur.""  Szetela tried to lie her way out of the case, but did not fool the judge. He was quoted as saying, ""I can’t believe you are that monumentally incompetent.” Does that sound like someone who should be entrusted with a position of power in our Redistricting commission? Absolutely not.  The fact that she is allowed to serve on the commission is appalling.  I demand Szetela issue an immediate resign from the commissioner. Under no circumstances should she be allowed to continue to serve on the commission. Our tax dollars should not propagate this type of racism and anti-Semitism, especially with the gravity of the work the Commission is completing.

780,written,,"midland,michigan",My thoughts,"Hi, my name is Jessica Acton. I live in Midland, Michigan. I am giving my comments to the Redistricting Commission because I want to see an end to gerrymandering in Michigan. Our new districts should be compact and should not favor one political party over the other. I think that is why 61 percent of Michiganders voted for Proposal 2, to make our elections fairer.  I want a State Senate District that keeps the Tri-Cities (Midland, Bay City, and Saginaw) together. For a very long time this area has been a community of interest. We share MBS airport, we share Delta College, which each county supports financially, and we share many economic concerns. Each of these three counties has a similar composition: a small city and many farming areas. It is also very popular in this area to attend cultural events in one of our sister cities, like the Bay City Fireworks, the Loons baseball games in Midland, or a Saginaw Spirits hockey game.  I want a State House District that keeps my county of Midland whole. When the district is split up, like it is now, it is more difficult for voters to know who their representative is, and it is more difficult for a representative to work for the needs of constituents who may belong to different communities of interest. County lines should be respected as much as possible when creating State House districts.  Our current U.S. House District is gerrymandered to stretch from Midland to Alpena to Gaylord. The counties containing those cities are far apart and have very different interests. The tourist industry in the northern counties is much different from the tourist industry in my area, for example. Please put the old districts aside and start fresh to create districts that unite counties with more in common. The Tri-Cities would fit well with Flint and Genesee County, as well as Gratiot, Clinton, and Shiawassee Counties, because of regional corporations such as General Motors, Michigan Sugar, and several healthcare systems, as well as many farms. They also share educational ties through local high schools as well as secondary education like Delta College, Saginaw Valley State University, Baker College, Mott Community College, and Northwood University.  I appreciate all the time and effort you each have committed to this Commission, and I thank you for considering my views.  Sincerely,  Jessica Acton"

784,written,,,Defeat the Dragons!,"Hello, my name is Cassie Foley, and I would like to thank you for all your time and effort as members of the first Michigan Redistricting Commission.  I know you have an important and difficult job, and I certainly appreciate your efforts.   My primary hope for redistricting is to eliminate oddly shaped, gerrymandered districts.  Please make districts as compact as possible and keep counties in the same district, when possible.  Please eliminate partisan ""safe"" districts so more Michiganders will feel like their vote matters.  Districts drawn without partisan goals will lead to more competitive elections and will result in legislators who represent a wider range of voters.   I collected signatures for Proposal 2 because I strongly believe that fairly-drawn districts will give Michigan better representation.  I hope you will ignore the previous districts completely and start fresh, with no partisan agenda as in the past.  I have lived in Midland for over 30 years, but I grew up in Bay City during my first 18 years.  This area, including Saginaw, is widely known as the Tri-Cities, and it has been that way my entire life.  I think this area should be recognized as a community of interest.  We are served by Tri-City Airport, now known as MBS in reference to all three counties; many of the tri-county residents attend Delta College, which is financially supported by all three counties, and we have several shared sports leagues located primarily in the Saginaw Valley, as our area is also known.  All three counties are similar in that they each have one middle-sized city, many rural farming areas, and the US 10/I-75 corridor, which is a strong industrial connection.  If Gladwin, Arenac, and Clare counties are added in, we are called the Great Lakes Bay Region.  I urge you to create compact districts for the U.S. House, the State Senate, and the State House that will unite the historical, cultural, and economic interests of our Tri-County area while maintaining the criteria established in our Michigan Constitution by the passage of Proposal 2.  Thank you again for serving on this Commission to bring fair districts to our great state!  Sincerely, Cassie Foley"

What happens, for instance,  when a distinct community lives on either side  of a county line? Should the map drawers keep  that  community  whole  or  follow  the  political   boundary?  Such  trade-offs  may  have  significant  impli- cations  for  both  racial  and  partisan  fairness.   Conflicting rules also can make map drawers’  task harder and, worse, open the door for peo- ple  who  want  to  manipulate  maps.  To  mini- mize the chances that such choices are used as  covers  for  redistricting  abuses,  it  is  important   to have clear criteria and for the criteria to be  ranked in order of priority. This is true regard- less  of  whether  lines  are  being  drawn  by  a   commission or by a legislature. We recommend that all states adopt the fol- lowing  criteria.  While  there  is  room  to  adjust   the wording to account for state-specific con- cerns, these rules reflect broadly applicable best  practices and consensus among a broad range  of good government and civil rights groups.  A. The [map-drawing entity] shall establish   single-member districts for [state house, state senate,  and Congress] using the following criteria as set forth  in the following order of priority: 1.  Districts shall be geographically contiguous. 2.  Districts shall provide racial minorities with an  equal opportunity to participate in the political  process and shall not dilute or diminish their  ability to elect candidates of choice whether  alone or in coalition with others. 3.  Districts shall minimize the division of communities  of interest to the extent practicable. A community of  interest is defined as an area with recognized  similarities of interests, including but not limited to  economic, social, cultural, geographic, or historic  identities. Communities of interest shall not include  common relationships with political parties,  officeholders, or political candidates. 4.  Districts shall respect the geographic integrity of  political subdivision boundaries to the extent that  preceding criteria have been satisfied. 5.  Districts shall be compact to the extent that  preceding criteria have been satisfied.* 6.  Districts shall encourage competition to the  extent that preceding criteria have been  satisfied.* B. The redistricting plan shall not, when considered   on a statewide basis, unduly favor or disfavor any  political party "
787,written,,,Considerations from a PoliSci Prof...,"Having taught Political Science/American Government courses for some 20 plus years at the Community College level, I believe it is extremely important to pay attention to the county lines in all districts (State and Federal) drawn.  Teaching students about representation and their role as the citizens who elect this representation should be a strong determinant in the consideration of how the state representative districts are drawn.  County Health Departments, County Road Departments, County Sheriffs, County Drain Commissioners each represent and provide direct services to the citizens of the state.  Counties are an extension of the State, created to carry out the duties and distributions as, ultimately, directed by our elected legislators (specifically, State Legislators).  Our counties create - by the very nature bureaucratic efficiencies - communities of interest.  Since the voters of the state of Michigan have not eliminated the role of the county - nor county districts - high emphasis should be placed on maintaining the full counties within as many districts as possible when drawing any of the district maps.  One issue (among many) regarding gerrymandering is (as the Supreme Court concluded) the difficulty in intuitively knowing who represents you.  Clearly defined, existing, and identifiable boundaries are best when it comes to ensuring citizens participate in the election process and direct (and hold accountable) their elected representatives.  Secondly, I - as is true of the far majority of those testifying and submitting maps - can only attest to my personal observations in terms of ""communities of interest.""  As a current resident of the City of Jackson (having grown up on the westerly side of the county, and residing in the city since 1988) who has worked in the City of Battle Creek since 1998, it is my observation that the City of Jackson shares  the exact interests of the City of Battle Creek. It's demographics, industrial base, histories and future are each inline with one another.  I do not believe this to be true regarding the interests of the City of Jackson and the City of Ann Arbor.  Neither in size nor scope.  In fact, a few years ago, when a diverse cadre of citizens from Jackson banded together, politically, to change legislation to include additional state ""Smart Zones"" (special taxing districts) to gain their own district, it was suggested that Jackson simply push to join the ""already existing Smart Zone of Ann Arbor.""  This suggestion was vigorously rejected as the diverse members (including persons from the local colleges, economic groups, township governments and the City of Jackson) recognized that Jackson's interests (it's ""community"") simply does not align with that of Ann Arbor.  Nothing against Ann Arbor... it's just not Jackson... nor is it Battle Creek.  Jackson and Battle Creek (and Albion), however, do very closely share interests.    It is my hope and suggestion that the Commission please take this testimony under consideration when crafting it's final district maps at all levels.  Your task is clearly monumental.  All my best to you each.    https://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20001017/SUB/10170854/medc-gets-smartzone-proposals"

We are a community of interest and a logical unit. In addition, it does not make sense to divide Midland County between districts. The Tri-Cities and Flint share news outlets. This district was created by a partisan gerrymandering. It's time to make the district boundaries logical based on common interests of the Tri-Cities using the new independent commission format which the people supported by vote.

Whenever it is practical, local boundaries should be used to determine voting districts (e.g., city, township, and county lines). When one of these entities is too small to constitute a district, then it should be combined with geographically adjacent units to make up the resulting district. If it is too large, then it should be divided as simply as possible, along geographic lines. The aim should be to create and maintain voting districts based on population patterns rather than partisan benefit."

797,written,,"lansing,lansing tri-county coi,coi,coi evidence,ingham-eaton-clinton coi",Lansing Tri-County COI evidence,"Members of the Commission:  I ask that as you draw maps for congressional districts, you consider the Lansing Tri-County region, comprising Ingham, Clinton, and Eaton Counties, as a community of interest and place it within one district.  The current map divides our region into three congressional districts, with Ingham bundled with Shiawassee and Oakland counties.  The Lansing region certainly has some commonalities with Shiawassee, but I have never heard a resident speak of Oakland County as part of an affinity group with us, nor are we part of a community of interest with Wexford or Lenawee.   I believe residents of Ingham, Clinton, and Eaton Counties do see themselves as a community of interest, but my assertion alone does not make it so.  You should rely on empirical evidence whenever possible, and I know you are attempting to do so.  With that in mind, I conducted a simple scan of public agencies, nonprofits, and commercial business listings on the Internet to learn about their regional identity.  A cursory Google search showed many entities that identify as part of this community.  I am certain that a more extensive effort would reveal hundreds more that identify similarly.  By contrast, I conducted the same scan looking for entities that identify their service area to include both Ingham and Oakland, and I found none.  Not one.    The following, then, is a partial list of entities that provide public services, social assistance, and commercial work in this self-defined tri-county region..  Through them, one can obtain health care, adopt a stray pet, start a small business, and get your drains cleaned, along with many other functions.  They tell their customers that their service area is Ingham, Clinton, and Eaton County (and in some instances as noted, Shiawassee), and to their customers, the residents of this region, that makes sense.  Together, they are in fact a multi-faceted community of interest.    Public Agencies •	Community Mental Health Authority of Clinton, Eaton, Ingham Counties •	State of Michigan Prosperity Region [Health and Human Services, Economic Development, Education, Agriculture and Rural Development, Natural Resources, etc.] •	Tri County Office on Aging •	Tri-County Metro Narcotics Squad •	Tri-County Regional Planning Commission [Planning; environmental quality; transportation; community and economic development; data and mapping] •	US Census: Metropolitan Statistical Area  Nonprofits •	Capital Area Community Services [Clinton, Eaton, Ingham, and Shiawassee] •	Capital Area Health Alliance •	Capital Area Humane Society •	Capital Area Michigan Works •	Capital Area United Way •	Capital Region Community Foundation  •	Capital Region Small Business Development Center •	Disability Network Capital Area [Clinton, Eaton, Ingham, and Shiawassee] •	Lansing Capital Area Salvation Army •	Lansing Economic Area Partnership [LEAP] •	RSVP of Ingham, Eaton, & Clinton Counties [Volunteer service program] •	Tri-County Alliance for Public Education •	Tri-County Bicycle Association •	Tri-County Crisis Intervention Team •	Tri-County TRIAD [Promotes older adult safety and reduces the fear of crime]   Businesses •	Ace Cleaning and Restoration: Serving the Lansing and the Tri-County Area   •	Ramsey Civil Process Service, Inc. •	Tri County Community Advocates •	Tri County Home Improvements •	Tri- County Maintenance •	Tri-County Emergency Medical Control Authority •	Tri-County Guardianship Services •	Tri-County Mobile Veterinary Clinic •	Tri-County Plumbing and Drain Cleaning Inc   •	Tri-County Realty   There are many  considerations involved in defining a community of interest, but taken together, these data are compelling.  I urge you to take seriously the voices of the public agencies, nonprofits, and businesses that are so important to our region, the Ingham, Eaton, Clinton community of interest.   "

Specifically, no district lines should cut across city lines. Americans' greatest cultural divide is based upon where we live: city or country. We identify ourselves and our way of life primarily by where we live; Michigan and West Michigan in particular are no exception.  We who live in rural areas have equal or higher rates of poverty and disability, and less access to new jobs; we deal with this by higher rates of entrepreneurship. We are innovative and self-reliant. We live close to the land. Soil, water, and weather determine how we spend our days to a greater degree than our urban friends and family. It's not a matter of right or wrong - it's a matter of where we choose to live, and wanting to keep it that way. It's a good way of life, and we want our elected representatives to be loyal to that.

Any districting plan so based will be inherently gerrymandered and contribute to continued social and political discord.   ""Communities of Interest"" are in reality nothing more than parochial special interest groups.   In fact, all other things being equal,  a good redistricting plan should divide ""Communities of Interest"" across multiple districts.    A proper districting plan should be based only on total population (all districts having equal population) and geographic compactness (all districts being geographically  as small and regular in shape as possible).  Additionally, the redistricting plan should ignore all internal state political subdivision boundaries.

Meanwhile, having safe districts encourages partisan extremism as the primary elections become the most important and candidates will push to be the most liberal or the most conservative candidate to win their party's support. Having safe districts is also a symptom of gerrymandering caused by packing and cracking of voters to dilute the voting power of a specific party. Having districts as close to 50-50 partisanship as possible will encourage elected officials to reach across the aisle and be a voice for everyone in their district, not just those in their party. Excessive partisanship is becoming a huge issue in Michigan politics. Let's bring back civility in politics and curb excessive partisanship by drawing more competitive districts. Thank you!"

I began to learn a powerful  lesson about how democracy in my district really works when I started to volunteer as a campaign worker for Democratic candidates.  Our Democratic candidates were always outspent by Republicans. Because of gerrymandering, we could never win. Several talented and intelligent candidates stepped forward to run as Democrats and serve in the state and Federal House and Senate; bright and hard working candidates who could have contributed new ideas to addressing problems and issues in our state: important issues like affordable housing, PFAS pollution, alternative energy, improving public education, and creating opportunity for all.  Time after time, our candidates were more informed and had a deeper background knowledge when discussing issues in debates and forums.  It didn't matter. The less informed candidates who followed the Republican talking points and really could not discuss issues with depth and insight, won. Republicans in these gerrymandered districts didn't really have to work that hard to win. Believe me, I  witnessed several lackluster Republican campaigns and candidates' canned comments on  important issues. The lesser qualified candidates went to Lansing to do the bidding of the Michigan Republican Party: keep Republicans in power and obstruct any legislation introduced by Democrats, especially women Democratic Governors: Jennifer Granholm and Gretchen Whitmer.  I watched it happen over and over again: Republicans outspent Democrats, the districts were gerrymandered, the Republican candidates could win no matter how little they participated in the election cycle and how little they actually knew or even cared about issues impacting their constituents. . The way the districts are currently drawn, I have no voice in my state or Federal legislative districts. With redistricting, I am hoping for a more intelligent and informed legislature in the state and in Washington DC. Our nation faces some huge challenges and we can not continue with this  type of corporate sponsored democracy that is currently plundering our nation and dismantling participatory democracy.  "
824,written,,,Communities of Interest,"I made an earlier comment on this subject, and now you’re asking me to draw a map, which leads me to believe you really didnt read my earlier comment. My comment…communities of interest is just another form of  gerrymandering and should not be considered.  "
825,written,,,Fair and equal -- blind justice," ‘The primary goal of the redistricting committee is to draw districts that are NOT gerrymandered.  Each time “communities of interest” are evaluated we invite bias and accept gerrymandering as acceptable.  Communities of interest include claims we should not divide church congregations, or “don’t let another school district into our political boundary"", or all in this area listen to the same radio station – keep out those who don’t, or this is a gated or special residential area and we want to be kept together, we must draw lines to hold others away. ---    “Communities of interest” are excuses for gerrymandering. No district should have more than six sides. All lines should be straight. Michigan’s Great Lakes shoreline should be the  the only exception. Almost every county government in every state in the country is square. It is possible to make political boundaries square too. If you start at one end (top or bottom) of the state and draw straight lines to create districts as square as possible, you reduce gerrymandering as much as possible.  As squares are stacked there may be need for rectangle shaped districts, but the only deviation from a straight line is to accommodate squares adjacent to another different size square or rectangle district.  The less square the political district is, the more the gerrymandering.  I urge the redistricting not to build off the map we have. The current map is gerrymandered.  Start with a fresh slate.  Make districts as square as possible regardless of where the lines fall. Making all districts as square as possible may not please everyone but we will not have gerrymandered districts.  The argument for gerrymandered districts pleases 2/3 of the redistricting committee. Those associated with Republicans and those associated with Democrats. Each political party can use “community of interest” to barter districts that benefit themselves. Putting like-minded Republicans or like-minded Democrats in the same district pleases that two thirds of the committee. It does NOT reduce gerrymandering. It perpetuates it. It is too bad that two thirds of the committee will likely put  party over elimination of gerrymandering.  If political boundaries are based on population only – square districts – political parties will get some of everything. They will formulate policies and laws that benefit everyone, not a gerrymandered majority.   This redistricting committee must eliminate gerrymandering. This committee only gets one chance. A square shaped district, blind to race, religion, national origin, or any other affiliation or political party affiliation,  must be adopted.  To draw this on a map is not difficult to do. Computers can draw similarly populated squares and stack them. some squares may be larger than others, but the computer can make them as close to square shaped as possible.  Some districts may end up being rectangular and some may have 6 sides to accommodate an adjacent square -- but the map will not be gerrymandered "
826,written,,,Redistricting,"Hello, Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments regarding the redistricting of Michigan for elections. I would request that the boundaries be drawn along current existing boundaries or jurisdiction such as towns, counties, townships, etc. Where lines must be drawn within higher populated jurisdictions, natural geographic boundaries can be used such as a river. Shapes of districts should be a neat and have compact shape as much as possible without stretching out and around and along what would be unusual to any reasonable person.  I value this opportunity for voters to pick their elected officials and that these officials represent the communities in and around where they live.  Thanks again for the opportunity and your service.  "
827,written,,,Pittsfield Township ,"I consider Pittsfield Twp a treasure chest because of its international and diverse population. We are surrounded by Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti, Saline, and other townships. We have Huron River, parks, community events and a historical treasure in Ypsilanti that is the underground railroad. I am happy living here we have access to healthcare, education, public transit and local public safety. However, Pittsfield Twp. is in Washtenaw County and  I think that splitting Washtenaw county weakens the federal support for services county wide. Services like broadband, water quality management, healthcare, education and public transit. I care about the availability  and accessibility of these supportive services to Washtenaw County as a whole, the splitting of the county means that there are some people who do not receive the support to have a better quality of life.  In particular the disadvantage of the splitting is especially experienced by the aging and lower income population. "

830,written,,,State of Michigan,"Michigan has been dropping quickly in the U.S. state rankings for many important  state responsibilities since the Michigan Republican Party took control of the redistricting process in Michigan. Since  the 1990’s Michigan has been steadily dropping in wages earned, quality of roads, child poverty increasing, government transparency, population count and many other responsibilities. Republican, one party control of redistricting has been the major factor in this travesty. Gerrymandering has been around for over a century and creates a situation where elected officials of both parties have very little chance of losing, this has become problematic for good government due to the Republican partisan application of artificial intelligence to the redistricting process . Many people don’t realize that elected official of the party out of power are actually the safest elected officials because they are in districts that are “packed”, in this case Democrats, and the party in control is safe, in this case the Republicans because of “cracking” districts. When elected officials have virtually no chance of losing, other than in the primary, they do not have to even consider constituents from the opposing party or their own for that matter. This is not only counter productive it helps create the distrust of citizens in government that has been growing since the 90’s. I would hope you would make every district being divided so that no party has greater than a 10% edge, preferable less unless a particular district would be covered by the Civil Rights Laws if at all possible. Non competitive districts are the biggest problem we have in the quest for good government in our state of Michigan!"
831,written,,"qualityeducation,diversityandinterdependence,endprisongerrymandering","Interdependence, Schools and Prisons","My Communities of Interest: An Emphasis on Diversity and Interdependence, School District Integrity, and an End to Prison Gerrymandering.  I have already addressed the MICRC twice before in person; first in Flint, and later in Port Huron. The guidance I sought to give the Commission was to have districts which are a balanced blend of urban and rural communities that reflect our state's rich diversity and the interdependence we have with one another. The analogy I presented was that I want to have our elected officials to “have their left foot in the city and their right foot in the country.” For although the district maps will be drawn based on where people live, they should also take into account where people work, play, and pray.  Municipal borders for counties, cities and townships should, of course, be considered, although I realize that some will have to divided so that districts have similar populations. Whenever possible, however, the Commission should try to prioritize, and not split up, local school districts. This is one community of interest which I think most Michiganders would agree on, as school districts should be united when electing their government leaders and in their political representation.  Lastly, the Commission must end prison gerrymandering. Counting incarcerated persons as residents of the areas where they are housed distorts our democratic process by artificially inflating the population count, and thereby the political influence, of the districts where prisons and jails are located. Incarceration is a bell weather of a society's failure to properly educate and provide services for its citizens. Communities from where incarcerated people originate should not have their political influences and government funding diverted to areas to where its citizens are temporarily being housed. "
832,written,,,Community of Interest Comments,"Community of Interest Comments Good evening. I am Diane Dunaskiss, Township of Orion, Oakland County.  I have given a good deal of thought to the redistricting process and to applying the concept of communities of interest in the development of districts for elections and for access to government representatives.  I believe that most people participate in several communities of interest simultaneously.  They may be advocating for their children in their school PTA, attend a local church, engage in activities at municipal recreation facilities or support the arts.  There interests may extend to a variety of groups of people and may extend to rural, suburban and urban areas.  There are undoubtedly thousands of communities of interest, but these are not limited by political boundaries.  People’s everyday lives tend to revolve around their immediate community.  Access to government officials and the ability of public servants to effectively represent them is of utmost importance when developing voting districts.   For these reasons, I am in support of the redistricting process giving a higher priority to keeping municipalities intact whenever possible when drawing the lines for new voting districts.  As an involved citizen in a community, it is important that the community as a whole have one congress person, one state senator and state representative and one county commissioner because it facilitates communication between constituents and their representatives and it enhances the ability of public officials understand the needs of the communities they represent.  We should strive to simplify access to our government, not complicate; it should be our goal to clarify the ballot, not make it more confusing; we should strive to unite communities, not divide them when they seek to address concerns with public officials.  With all the concern regarding election integrity, regardless of your feelings on recent events, I believe everyone wants their vote to be accurately counted.  Because the bulk of this responsibility lies in the hands of our municipal clerks, one of the best ways I can think of to ensure the safety of our votes is to honor municipal boundaries when redistricting   So I ask this commission to give priority municipal boundaries to simplify not complicate, to clarify not confuse and to unify not divide the election process for our voters.

We are asking the commission to draw a district that serves the best interest of our families, schools and businesses without divides.  Our community is spread over several densely populated neighborhoods and one of the most diverse neighborhoods in Grand Rapids with a large population of Latino families living along side populations of African immigrants, Black and White families.  With a medium household income much lower than Grand Rapids overall, our neighborhoods are rich in culture and spirit. Their many vibrant, long-standing family-owned businesses mixed with new shops in traditional mixed-use neighborhoods are our pride and joy. Grand Rapids Westside + Greater Westside is also home to the Cook Arts Center, the Hispanic Center, The Salvation Army Krok Center, long, established churches and schools and several beautiful public parks.  Our top issues are affordable and secure housing, walkable and safe streets, secure employment with family-living wages and benefits and community health. These are not unique to our district yet are the issues that certainly shape our future and impacts each household daily.

834,written,,,existing boundaries,"To the Independent Redistricting Commission:  I am distressed to receive an email from you saying that I described a “community of interest” in my public submission.  That is not correct and, most worrisome, suggests that you are unfairly mischaracterizing submissions.  My view was and is that to the maximum extent possible you should draw lines for compact areas based on existing units such as cities, townships, and counties.  I think it important that everyone in my city of Northville know that they are represented by so and so, who also represents everyone in Northville Township or Novi or whatever.  The point is, use existing governmental lines so voters easily know their representatives and representatives easily know their votes.     And, for the avoidance of doubt, I want everyone in Northville to be in the same district whether they are rich or poor, Black or white, old or young, you name it.  I do not want Michigan divided up into another bunch of districts that seem on a map to have no rhyme or reason.  By taking my submission and characterizing as in favor of communities of interest I fear very much that you are biasing your results in that direction.  I want existing lines to be used and I want compact districts.  Thank your for your attention."

837,written,,"west michigan,holland,grand haven,lakeshore ,small business ",Ottawa County as a Community of Interest,"Members of the Redistricting Commission, thank you for taking the time to hear public comment on this important process. My name is Hunter Ihrman and I am a lifelong resident of Ottawa County.   I strongly encourage you to consider all of Ottawa County as a community of interest and keep the County intact when it comes to creating legislative districts. This means, no State House or State Senate seat should divide the county.   Ottawa County is geographically and economically distinct from its neighboring counties and because of these unique characteristics, Ottawa County residents deserve representation from individuals who actually live in and understand the jurisdiction. Splitting the county is also extremely taxing on our local government, increases the costs of administering elections, and confuses voters who have spent the last 10 years living in districts that lie entirely within Ottawa County.   I would like to point out that Ottawa County is a lakeshore community. Lake Michigan is vital to the local economy and generations of residents have supported their families based on opportunities the lakeshore provides--especially tourism, which allows small businesses to thrive. Residents across Ottawa County’s cities--Grand Haven, Holland, Ferrysburg, Zeeland, Hudsonville, Allendale, and many others--are similar in their values, culture, and heritage. Simply put, Ottawa County is unique among its neighboring jurisdictions and deserves its own representation at the local level.   I also urge the commission to keep the Second Congressional district similar to its current boundaries. The Second District encompasses all of Ottawa County as well as a number of neighboring counties on the lakeshore. Many residents in this area travel north and south along US-31 for work, and for this reason I support keeping both Ottawa County and Muskegon County in the Second District. The Ludington area is also economically similar to Ottawa County, with its strong reliance on lakeshore tourism. The value of the lakeshore is immense to these communities, and at the federal level, West Michigan residents deserve a district that considers the importance of Michigan’s natural water features.   In summary, I urge the commission to take action in two key ways:  1. Keep Ottawa County whole for State House and State Senate districts 2. Keep the lakeshore intact (Ottawa County, Muskegon County, Lake County, Oceana County, Newaygo County, and Mason County) for Congressional districts.   Thank you for the opportunity to share my perspective. "
838,written,,"arabnarratives,arabvoices,arabamerican,mena,wearemena,immigrants,dearborn city,dearborn heights city,hamtramck city,melvindale city",A letter from an Arab immigrant,"Dear the Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission:  My name is Mariam Akanan, a first-generation Arab immigrant, a resident of DearbornHeights, a temporary Master of Social Work student resident of Ann Arbor, and a  full-time civic engagement specialist in Dearborn with the Arab Community Center for Economic andSocial Services (ACCESS). I write to you today preeminently to amplify the needs of myCommunity of Interest.  As you may already know, Metropolitan Detroit is home to one of the largest and most diverse Arab and Middle Eastern & North African (MENA) communities outside theArab/MENA region. At least 3.5 million Americans of Arab descent live in the United States ofAmerica yet are not represented in Census data as unique racial and ethnic categories. OurCommunity of Interest, the Arab/MENA American community, primarily lives in Dearborn,Dearborn Heights, West Detroit, and Melvindale, as well as other parts of Michigan such asHamtramck, Sterling Heights, Flint, Livonia, Canton, Ferndale, Ypsilanti, Ann Arbor, and throughout the nation. It originates from culturally, geographically, and religiously diverse countries, embodying many experiences and narratives that cannot be distilled to a singular experience or partisan lines. Without a fair count of us, we are constantly invisible and not factored into this part of the political process of redistricting.  Guided by Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits minority vote dilution, I respectfully ask the MICRC not to divide my Community of Interest - historically underrepresented - but rather, to reflect it throughout the redistricting process fairly.Drawing district lines without splitting Communities of Interests will provide us with an equitable opportunity to participate in the overall political process and to elect representatives of our choice. The Arab/MENA American community is much larger and more diverse than it has ever been. Today, much like any other long-term demographic,Arab/MENA Americans are not concentrated in one part of Michigan. We have been involved in the economy and culture of Southeast Michigan for well over one hundred years and have made civic, cultural, and economic contributions to civil society. According to Smith (2012),Arab/MENA Americans’ economic activities are responsible for supporting and creating between 99,494 and 141,541 jobs in Michigan’s southeast counties of Macomb, Oakland, Washtenaw and Wayne in Michigan. Unfortunately, the importance of my Community ofInterest, the Arab/MENA American community, has been underreported and has received little attention (Abraham & Shryock, 2000; Smith et al., 2012).  The Arab/MENA community continuously faces unique challenges. My community has faced, for years, negative stereotyping, discrimination, and political exclusion. We have many shared concerns, including labor conditions and discrimination, civil rights and equality, access to health care, culturally sensitive integrated health and social services, language accessibility, political representation, safe infrastructure, environmental justice, ancestral homeland conflicts, and immigration issues, in addition to the constant feeling of being an accepted part of the American society and its politics. Moreover, depending on how long an individual has been in the U.S., language barriers can be obstacles to integrating intoAmerican society. I have witnessed family members encounter challenges in obtaining culturally and linguistically appropriate services and resources. The truth is, if it weren’t for immigrant-based-organizations, it would have taken years for many newly arriving immigrants and refugees, like my parents, for example, to feel part of the larger society. As a first-generation Arab/MENA Immigrant who is privileged in many ways, including the ability to write this letter in English, I must further contribute to preceding civic engagement and advocacy efforts led by courageous Arab/MENA immigrants that arrived in Dearborn before me. It is also my responsibility to educate myself and others around historical events and social justice issues as they pertain to our community and other communities of color, black communities, indigenous communities, and other ethnic and racial minority groups.  Reflecting on the history of Dearborn, and in particular the early presence of Arab/MENA members in the Southend, we can notice that Arab/MENA or immigrant-led organizations, such as the Arab American University Graduates AAUG, the Southeast Dearborn CommunityCouncil (SEDCC), Palestinian and Yemeni activists (note: together they founded ACCESS),collectively, supported and empowered the increased influx of Arab/MENA immigrants in70s. Today, 50 years later, we are still here, working with local partners to continue to meet the overwhelming needs of the community. We appreciate MICRC’s dedication to the redistricting process and your willingness to learn about the different communities around the State of Michigan. We are particularly thankful for the opportunity to share with the MICRC our needs and concerns as a Community ofInterest last month during the public hearing in Dearborn. Commissioners, you have the ability to draw district lines and maps that influence Michigan’s local, state, and national political landscape for years. We urge you to look at various findings that can be just for ourCommunity of Interest and neighboring communities. The Census data does not reflect ourCommunity of Interest; It takes away our shared history, heritage, and narrative.Demographic population data are usually collected through the Census, AmericanCommunity Survey, or other instruments. In this light, I encourage the MICRC to employ comprehensive procedures and tools that seek to understand communities from a sociocultural, environmental, economic, and political lens in which they historically existed and exist today.  We will be submitting a more thorough report to the MICRC, including lived experiences of my Community of Interest. Once submitted, we hope that the information serves as an example of how human-centric and multi-layered approaches can further help explore and understand various Communities of Interest.  Again, thank you for your time and efforts throughout this critical process. Please do not hesitate to contact us if we can be of any assistance to you.

842,written,,,Maximize Competitive Districts,"I would encourage the commission to a adapt as a primary goal maximizing the number of competitive districts in the state of Michigan.   Ideally, all districts would be drawn in such a way that any candidate could win in a district in a given year and no elections be foreordained or ""safe"". Michigan's representatives in Washington and Lansing will need to represent the views of hundreds of thousands  and tens of thousands of of citizens respectively and there is no perfect system be it mathematical or technocratic to aggregate these views into a a finite number of large districts. Still, I think representative democracy and self governances works best when elections are completive and elected representatives compete and continue to complete for votes. Having elected representatives who do not feel the need to be attentive to all their constituents seems to me to undermined this ideal.   That said, I do realize that other considerations make the goal of having every district  perfectly competitive, if not impossible, highly impractical. And geography, demographics, existing political boundaries and polities. are legitimate considerations.  Therefore I am *not* suggesting this one criteria be used to the exclusion of all others.  I would encourage the commission to adapt *secondary* goals of rational geographies, compactness, and holding communities together.   The process of drawing political districts draws is fraught with interests in direct tensions with one and other and what to prioritize is  a deeply political question. But in my opinion ensuring competitiveness in each district best serves the interest of citizenry and the state as a whole. "

A state senate district that includes the Tri Cities, Saginaw, Bay City and Midland would make sense as these communities are connected by a shared airport, major employers such as Dow Chemical, Delphi Corp., the Michigan sugar Corp., Delta College, Saginaw Valley University, Northwood University, shopping and shared cultural venues.    I want a US congressional District that includes the Tri Cities and Flint.  The reasons are the same as my previous comments.  During my time living in the area, we traveled to these areas frequently for our kids school activities and sports, shopping, museums, etc.  These cities are connected in many ways.  We really need a state house district that keeps midland county whole. I don’t see the need to reach out of our county for voters when the county shares so many obvious interests and services. This would help eliminate some of the extraordinary costs of candidates when running for office. "

853,written,,,Commissioner Szetela Should Apologize ,"While not many people were tuned in to last night’s hearing, I, unfortunately, watched a new low in terms of behavior from Commissioner Rebecca Szetela.  The Commission has gone so far out of the way to be accommodating to individuals with different backgrounds and abilities, spending $900/hour to provide alternate language services during meetings. The Commission decided inclusivity was something worthy of heavy taxpayer investment, which is great. However, Commissioner Szetela decided to go after another commissioner for her health condition. I was flabbergasted when this occurred. What happened to inclusivity, Commissioner Szetela? Not only that, but she made veiled disparaging remarks about rural communities. Is this what the commission stands for – profiling, disparaging stereotypes? If the commission deems discriminatory behavior acceptable, we might as well not spend $900/hour on language services for the 10-20 people who watch these meetings. If Commissioners can be discriminatory, let’s not pretend this commission is also inclusive. It CANNOT be both ways. Either Commissioner Szetela apologizes for her disparaging remarks about health status, or the Commission is wasting taxpayer dollars to put on a charade of inclusivity to hide the discriminatory beliefs of commissioners.  The other commissioners (everyone present but Commissioner Clark) who were bystanders during Szetela’s bigoted attack must disavow this type of behavior immediately if this Commission can continue "
854,written,,,Thank You MICRC from the Tri-Cities,"Greeting, I'm a life long resident of Midland, now retired.

As a Midland voter I would like to offer my input on your efforts: MI State Senate I have worked in all three of the Tri-Cities and understand how they are all connected as a community of interest. We share employment, roads, an airport, High Schools, Colleges, sport teams, recreation, etc. Our common interests are varied and many. We should be represented in the Senate as the community of interest that we are.  US Congress As with the MI Senate, the Tri-cities and also Flint are communities of interest. These four cities represent the heart of mid Michigan. Employment opportunities,  infrastructure, Lake Huron, education, health care, etc., link us and we should be represented as such. MI State House. Midland County is without doubt a community of interest and should be totally in one district. It's a burden on candidates and not inclusive to all Midland County residents to split us up.  Thanks for your consideration and all the best wishes on your critical endeavors. "
855,written,,,Tri-Cities is a community of interest,"To members of the MICRC,  As the Commission undertakes its duties to create new congressional and state house and senate districts under the 2020 Census, I would like to submit my support for keeping the counties of Midland, Bay and Saginaw together in one district, as the three counties constitute a community of interest.  I am a resident of Midland and I have been a professor at Saginaw Valley State University for 34 years. The University traces its history back to the 1950's, when a committee of 300 ""was drawn from the three counties of Saginaw, Midland and Bay"", and issued a report that recommended the establishment of a four-year institution of higher learning for the region (""Saginaw Valley College Catalogue - 1964-65"", p. 6). A location was selected for the University that would be accessible to residents of all three counties. The establishment of Delta College, the area's community college, also shares this history. The history of the establishment of Delta College and Saginaw Valley College (now named Saginaw Valley State University) reveals the strong ties among the three counties, ties that have been reinforced over the last half-century by the existence of these two institutions in what, for many years, has been referred to as the Tri-Cities. (The term GLB--Great Lakes Bay--has been used recently, but most local residents still use the term Tri-Cities.) I can attest to the high levels of community engagement fostered by Delta College and SVSU that have strengthened the bonds of this community.  As you pursue your task of establishing new districts, please keep in mind the nature of our community as revealed by the history of our region. Thank you for your service as a member of the Commission.  Sincerely,  Deborah R. Bishop, Ph.D. Midland"

We share resources like our Center for the Arts, Dow Diamond, Dow Event Center, Dow Gardens, and Delta College Planetarium.   I am a chemical engineer at Dow and work with several contractors, many of which are located in Bay City and Saginaw. Several of our employees come from the Tri-city area too.  To make it simple, I would like our Michigan House District to be limited to Midland County.  Running a House District in two different counties is too difficult. "
857,written,,,"Tri-Cities: Bay City, Midland & Saginaw","To the Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission:  I am a resident of the city of Midland and have been for 30 years. When we first moved to the area, people said welcome to the Tri-Cities. Over the years, I have come to understand what that means. Our commerce is intertwined in groups such as the Great Lakes Bay Alliance. Many of our major nonprofits merged about 7 years ago to form Tri-city offices. Our college education systems are located in the Tri-city region. MBS airport is a shared resource, and our farming community works together.  I believe both our US Congressional map and our Michigan State Senate District should work to keep this area together to continue the progress of making our area stronger.  In 2020, I was the campaign manager for Sarah Schulz who was a democrat running in the 98th district. The current district lines for the 98th include most of Midland County and a small northern section of Bay County. Campaigning in this district was difficult because you had to keep track of two different county event calendars.  But the biggest reason this district was difficult is the disconnection of the two communities. The disconnection was most evident during the flood in Midland County. The flood was all-consuming for the residents of Midland County but many of the people of Bay County had no understanding of the damage. Bay County residents are concerned with Bay County which makes sense since most of their infrastructure is tied to Bay City. When someone from Pinconning wants to go shopping or get services, they go to Bay City, not Midland. And when people from Gladwin want an orthodontist, they come to Midland.  I believe the Michigan House districts should keep counties together."

Whereas when you leave Wyoming and enter Byron Center, it's very obvious; there's a large commercial and residential gap between the two cities.

My husband and I have raised two daughters in this shoreline community.  I would like to thank each of you for serving on this commission. Your hard work and dedication have not gone unnoticed.   I am very much a supporter of Proposal 2. I was so pleased to see that the recommendation of the Redistricting Process SubCommittee is to start from scratch when drawing district maps. This is what the citizens of Michigan have been waiting for. I believe this is a fair, unbiased way to approach your work. Thank you for that.  As I mentioned, I live in Grand Haven, yet, I worked right here in Muskegon, another lakeshore community. I shop in Muskegon as much as I shop in Grand Haven. I go to the symphony in Muskegon.  I eat out in Muskegon. I cross country ski in Muskegon. I took classes in Muskegon. I have a daughter and grandchildren in Muskegon. I have friends in Muskegon. Muskegon is very, very close. It is connected. It is part of my home.   Though in different counties, these two cities are joined at the hip by a duned, sandy, continuous coastline. The industry, tourism, lifestyle, and lumbering history are common. My community is dependent on this shoreline. Grand Haven and Muskegon along with the other lakeshore communities make up a significant community of interest, the Lake Michigan West Coast. We need governmental representation that understands the values and interdependence of this natural resource. We need districts that share the common bond of the shoreline. It is the life blood of our community.   Farmland and orchards also exist in both Ottawa and Muskegon Counties. These communities are on the east side of the counties, away from the lakeshore. These rural areas have different needs than the lakeshore and should have different representation.   I don’t see or feel that Northwest Ottawa County and Southwest Muskegon County are different. Their county lines are invisible. The commission could join these areas easily because they are geographically contiguous. Cities and townships could remain whole.

I have listened to many speakers voice their concerns at some of your public hearings, and it is inspiring to hear so many people speak up on behalf of their community. With so many folks passionate about having their individual communities of interest represented in a cohesive manner, I think one of the crucial requirements per the Constitution of the new district lines has been pushed out of the spotlight: the new lines must represent PARTISAN FAIRNESS.   To illustrate this importance, in our state house elections since the year 2000, one party has won the popular vote seven out of ten times,but subsequentially only held a majority of seats three out of ten times. For a map representing truly fair districts of partisanship, the party that collects the most votes should hold the most seats. In any other scenario, the will of the voters is being undermined by an unfair systemic bias.  While some folks may romanticize the idea of a map with perfect orthogonal lines, the purpose of the commission is to map districts in the fairest and equitable way. A few squiggly lines is a worthy sacrifice to achieve the greater purpose of the commission and the voters who overwhelming supported new districts with zero partisan bias.  I know you are hearing so much feedback on individual local communities. While these requests are genuine, please do not overlook the main sweeping purpose of this commission to make the new districts uphold partisan fairness.  With gratitude, Maxwell Lewis"

The districts should have a fair representation of the electorate within the district by socioeconomic situation as well as ethnic background diversity based on latest census. Fair does not mean an exact match, but rather a close resemblance to the census report. Contiguous districts would also share in these distributions relative to their own census reflections. Long, skinny districts do not have enough likeness from one end to the other and they may not have any knowledge of candidates for election."

Democratic candidates won a narrow majority of votes (with a margin of about 2.5% of the two party vote), but Republicans won 58 % of the state’s districts. Because of gerrymandering, despite a significant increase in voting margin for Democrats in 2018, control of Michigan’s house and Senate did not change.  The majority of the gerrymandering effort in Michigan was funded by Republicans (and strategically planned and made possible by computer generated algorithms) so that Republicans could keep getting elected and maintain their power in congress despite the fact that that this allows for governing by the minority not the majority. Our country’s constitution describes and allows for majority rule and minority rights. Our government is supposed to rely on the consent of the governed, and when this doesn’t happen, then it’s not democracy. It’s not fairness: its manipulation.  Our state constitution says that “Districts shall not provide a disproportionate advantage to any political party.”  That’s why fair maps are so important.  It is the function of the Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission is to return fairness to the drawing of the maps that define districts. When maps are drawn fairly, this generally lets the party that gets the most votes win the most seats. It’s important that Republicans are represented by Republicans in their districts and Democrats are represented by Democrats in their districts. The right thing to do is to draw our districts with as much fairness as possible using the proper tools. Gerrymandering is a measurable thing.  We have it, it has been measured and it clearly needs to be fixed.  (The Citizen’s Research Council of Michigan is a privately funded, not-for-profit public affairs research organization, founded in 1916. The Citizens Research Council of Michigan is non-partisan and independent; it does not lobby, support or oppose candidates for public office, or take positions on ballot issues.) "
873,written,,,My opinion ,I think districts should be geographically contiguous.
874,written,,,East Grand Rapids District,"My district is paired with Battle Creek instead of Grand Rapids, which is over an hour south and east. I would like to see my district paired with my surrounding area so that my interests are represented by a leader who lives in metro area."
875,written,,,Pat's Plan,"Simply divide the states population by the number of districts. Start at the southern state line, move north by latitude, across the entire state until it encompasses that percent of the population. Repeat until you have all districts. Revise every census year."
876,written,,ogemaw,Neutral & fair principles ,"The best way to end the gerrymandering that has plagued this state is by using neutral and reasonably shaped boundaries based on county, city, and township boundaries. Drawing districts based on municipal boundaries promotes a fair, neutral, and non-partisan redistricting plan. In short, it takes the ""politics"" out of voting districts.   Stop the gerrymandering practice of using race, ethnicity, religion, and other suspect classes to draw districts. Using race, ethnicity, and religion to draw district voting lines is unconstitutional, discriminatory, divisive, and blatant gerrymandering. "
877,written,,,Working for the Watershed,"Many of us, especially environmentalists and conservationists, agree that it's best to manage our natural resources, our local economies and our society based on watershed boundaries. Water and wildlife don't see geopolitical boundaries that we impose on them but are greatly impacted, which in turn affects watershed residents and quality of life. Inland farming, for instance, is needed to sustain our economy and our lifestyles. Yet farming in the headwaters and along streams the agriculture industry affects the health of the entire watershed, often without accountability, oversight or even comprehension of downstream and wider impacts. Drawing our districts according to watersheds and subwatersheds would help to educate our citizens, officials and youth about how everything is connected, and could reorient our communities to consider our individual and group roles in shaping the environment and social networks.  In the St. Clair River watershed, where I live, our greatest assets are the beautiful rivers, parks, and green spaces we share, enjoy and attract visitors with. These natural pillars of our community need advocacy and cooperative protection to mitigate threats such as invasive species and climate change, but we are currently operating as siloed departments and commissions. For example, the hydro-axing (a.k.a. “tree butchering”) our road commission engages in shows that the commission is only focused on human safety and annual costs with little regard to the environmental and property value impacts of their management activities. If every department in every agency were given the incentive and support to operate collaboratively and holistically, we could stop ignoring and deferring environmental protections and burdening future generations with the results of today’s actions and neglect. Over time, a watershed approach to redistricting would lead to knowledgeable, caring communities with members, elected officials, and industries working together to sustain not only our environmental assets, but each other. "
878,written,,,No special consideration for Christians,"After having noted that certain Christian parishes requested the districting lines to place all of the connected churches in a common district, I feel the need to point out that this would violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. There is no room for special preferential consideration of mutually associated Christian churches. Notably, the churches are not representative of the local population as a whole because those Christians live among citizens of many other faiths within the same residential areas. Citizens of other religious affiliations would be put at a disadvantage. It is impossible to give preferential treatment to all of them, so none of them should receive preferential considerations. The district lines must be based on other commonalities than religion."
879,written,,,Monroe Michigan,"My community of interest and home is in Monroe. It sits on the 1-75 corridor, Lake Erie and the River Raisin runs through it. Monroe, a city of approximately 20,000 people share some economic , social and environmental similarities with larger urban areas like the Downriver cities and Detroit.  The opioid crisis is a major problem and has taken a toll on our community.. Monroe County has one of the highest drug overdose rates per capita in Michigan.The city is an easy 1-75 stop off for drug and sex trafficking between Toledo and Detroit .  Our waterways and air suffer. Lake Erie, a few years ago, had one of the worst algae problem in 50 years. Water and air pollution are another community of interest. My family often ride bikes at Sterling State Park where we frequently smell oil or some unidentifiable substance on the trails as we ride or walk.  Monroe lost businesses and big box stores before Covid 19 and job growth continues to be a concern.  I choose to map Monroe with  the Downriver communities and Detroit because we share similar community of interest  and challenges. "
880,written,,,Competative mapping in Macomb County,"Good day, I hope you are doing well. I believe it is simply critical for a fair district across the entire state. I am speaking today specifically about Macomb County. As a democrat, I have spent 8 years watching the other democrats in my district have no representation. Not only from the GOP gerrymandered majority, but also from the Democratic party itself. Because the lines are so skewed, the party ignores members out here. It's harmful to the people, and they are often ignored for favor of the cities and more suburban areas. That means our concerns have no one to represent them. The people out here working for the party have no one to help them, and even this commission didn't hold a hearing in CD 10. That is how little representation and attention we get.  Can we please get some fair representation?"
881,written,,,Downriver is a Community of Interest,"I live on Grosse Ile which is part of an area of Southeast Michigan often referred to as ""downriver."" As a community of interest, downriver has traditionally shared not only recreation, schools, churches, and community events but also police and emergency support through the Downriver Mutual Aid agreement that pairs local police, SWAT, hazardous spill responses and other emergency services among communities for over 40 years.   We share the waterfront and access to boating, kayaking, local rowing teams and share concerns about the development of the waterfront as well (specifically the development of the former McLouth Steel toxic/polluted site which is currently being cleaned up but who's future may bring more undesirable heavy industry to the area.) When companies wanted to store giant piles of Pet Coke which was dangerous to all who lived nearby, communities worked together to oppose it.  The communities commonly referred to as downriver are attached in an upload here on a map and are   Allen Park Brownstown Township Ecorse Flat Rock Gibraltar Grosse Ile Township Huron Charter Township New Boston Waltz Willow Lincoln Park Melvindale River Rouge Riverview Rockwood Romulus Southgate Taylor Trenton Woodhaven Wyandotte  Geographic proximity are a given as evidenced by the attached map but the history of community support and shared interests and concerns also makes us a community of interest. We dine, work and travel between our local communities on a daily basis. My husband and I personally live on Grosse Ile, own a business in Lincoln Park, a rental home in Wyandotte and dine in 6 or 7 of the local communities on a regular basis. What happens in one community directly affects another.   The ""free"" county bridge that allows access to Grosse Ile near Trenton has been closed for over a year for repairs which has hurt businesses big and small in Trenton and on Grosse Ile. Local hospital traffic has all been rerouted to Wyandotte which affects not only the Wyandotte hospital but the hospital in Trenton who now gets less business because of the closure. Grosse Ile is tiny community of 5,000 homes and about 10,000 people and we rely heavily on our neighbors for many services including the Mutual Aid/Rescue mentioned above.   I'm truly not aware of the population limits on districts but Downriver should be kept together as much as possible.   I appreciate the hard work facing each of you and for your consideration on this redistricting.   "
882,written,,,Minimizing contiguous districts,"Cheering for the success of Michigan's new Commission.  I am a former resident of Grosse Pointe Park, a 1970 graduate of Univ. of Kansas with a degree in Political Science, a Vietnam Vet.  One simple test of fairness is to consider exactly how many contiguous districts any particular district touches.  A baseline number of 4 or 5 would allow any district over that number to be examined with particular, or strict, if you will, scrutiny, for biased or unbalanced numbers.  Another less simple test of fairness is to rank proposed districts by their variation from the state registrations means.  Some districts will necessarily vary greatly by urban, suburban, ex-urban or rural registration patterns.  But the final approved district maps with an identifiable percent of districts with substantial variation from state registration means should reflect the overall state registration.  For example if state registration is 45/40/15 (Party A/B/independent or other), then the districts that vary should be in the same proportion.  The difficult decision which must be done, and what will define you as an ""Independent"" Commission, will be to decide what is the variation that is unavoidable, tolerable and intolerably unfair.  State registration as a basis for the proportional number of unavoidably varied districts is not only fair but a basis of a rational reapportioning system.  Best of luck ."

890,written,,,Communities of Interest = Gerrymandering,"Hello, I attended the Gaylord meeting last month.  I had a realization when I was sitting there - any and all trying to maneuver for communities of interest is actually gerrymandering.  If this committee is to be successful and fair - the only thing it need do is focus on geographical areas with the smallest perimeter possible.  The larger the perimeter of the area, the more it is carved up to include little pockets of this or that type of voter to fit a particular agenda.....just try to contain the districts and let the people sort them out as much as possible.  Also, the current attempt by the SOS to buy more time is illegal, and her whims should not be entertained.  She has political motives, and is not to be trusted with the people's work.  We voted and now you have a job to do - it should be completed in the allotted time frame.     Let's face it, the only people in Michigan still using covid as an excuse not to do work are government employees.   The rest of us have been working (and paying taxes) all along......"
891,written,,,Downriver/Northeast Monroe Co.,"I live on the shores of Lake Erie in Frenchtown Township, Monroe County, MI.  We built our retirement “dream home” here in 2007 moving from the City of Wayne, Wayne County.  We’ve owned this property since 1985 and my husband has spent summers in this area since 1955 – needless to say, we’ve been around here awhile. Our area is often referred to as “The Beaches” of Monroe County.  The Beaches line Brest Bay and Stony Point Peninsula, which we live on, forms the northern edge of the bay.  We literally have the DTE Monroe (coal powered) power plant to our right view (southeast) and the stacks of the DTE Fermi Atomic Power Plant to our north.  Much of our daily lives are controlled, therefore, by our environment. My Community of Interest is the area along with shores of “downriver” Wayne County – shores lines with coal-powered power plants owned primarily by DTE Energy, the communities surrounding these plants of Ecorse, Lincoln Park, Southgate, Wyandotte, Trenton, Gibraltar, eastern Berlin Township, eastern Frenchtown Township, City of Monroe, eastern Monroe Township, and LaSalle Township.  These communities line the shores of the southern Detroit River, and western Lake Erie.  The Rouge River, Huron River, Swan Creek, Stoney Creek, River Raisin all feed into it.  Environmental issues abound and are made worse by climate change, decades of lax environmental regulations and corporate farmers putting their bottom line above the interests and health of their neighbors. Our air was polluted for 40 years by the Monroe Power Plant owned and operated by DTE Energy which has – just in the last 8 years – and as a result of enforcement of the Clean Air act, been forced to install “scrubbers” to take the majority of the pollutants out of the discharge.  This plant – all by itself – was credited for the majority of “acid rain” falling on the shores of southwest Ontario.  We used to watch the orange stream of pollution blow by daily.  DTE has notified the County of Monroe and City of Monroe it intends to close this plant within the next ten years. To my north is the Fermi Atomic Power Plant II – all the nuclear waste is currently stored there on site – nuclear waste gathered there for over 60 years – DTE also owns this plant and has avoided necessary updating by applying for a license to build a new nuclear power plant adjacent to this one – Fermi III – however, no action has been taken to actually do this – but since they applied for the license – certain repairs to Fermi II may be avoided since it’s going to be replaced – maybe.   Both these plants sit on the banks of Lake Erie – in addition with the excessive rain and run-off from upper levels of the Great Lakes – it all ends up in Lake Erie – yep – lots of rain, dumping of sewage plants that are not built to process this run-off – and we get to scoop it up off our beaches.   However, none of this can compare with the algae blooms – the stench so bad that windows cannot be opened – huge flies that live on top of the water feeding on the rot floating there.   And-I haven’t mentioned the flooding – oh the flooding – that has become an annual affair – the unbelievable cost of FEMA flood insurance – sometimes adding 3 to 4 THOUSAND dollars a year to your homeowners insurance premium.  It has priced the majority of homebuyers out of this market – the alternative to paying this is to pay cash for the house so a mortgage isn’t needed.  Our home is a “new build” and was built to have everything above the flood plain so our flood insurance – while still not inexpensive – is affordable for us.  We are the exception in our community. This is what comes from non-representative government here in the State of Michigan.

I am a white woman living in Maple City, Cleveland township, district number 6, home of the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore park, in Leelanau county, home of the indigenous Anishinaabae reservation and the Leelanau Conservancy, one of the oldest and most respected conservation organizations in the nation.  I live on land originally inhabited by the Anishinaabae people and all of their relations, which is to say all of the natural world.  My home place is on Lime Creek which flows into Lime Lake and makes its way through Shetland and Shalda Creeks and Little Traverse Lake into the Great Lake Michigan; the Good Harbor watershed.   I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in the redistricting effort.  I am encouraged that this concept of “communities of interest” has been imagined and put forward as an innovative means of addressing the voter manipulation (gerrymandering) of the past.    My community of interest consists of the population in Leelanau county and the portion of the Grand Traverse county contiguous to it who hold as a sacred trust the awareness of and care for the natural world we all depend on for our lives:  the water, air, soil, plants, trees, animals, birds, and all the other-than-human beings and inclusive of human beings.  This community of interest depends on the support of legislation and economic decisions that consider and respect these others.  There is a large percentage of the human population in this area that are involved in some way with this care of the earth:  the night sky, pure water, alternative energy, the trees and soil remediation, the wildlife, pollinators, each other, and in teaching children the ways of nature and our human responsibility to care for these gifts of life.  This community of interest imagines a district that fairly reflects the need and views of those who live on, learn from and care for that place.  We aim for a district that helps, not hinders, voters in being able to choose the representatives they want and need.  I sincerely appreciate being heard and thank all who are helping Michigan become a more represented state.  With Gratitude and Regard, Carol Laughing- Waters "

896,written,,,Crossing The Lines,"Hello and thank you for the honor of asking me for my assistance in redrawing the lines here in Michigan.  It was an honor to have spoken at one of your public hearings giving my input on such a serious matter.  I do believe when I addressed the panel of 13 commissioners, I compared sketching these new lines as if it were a “Crime Scene” being sketched out.  We all know what happens in a taped off crime scene area right?  That area alone is looked at and monitored very differently from any open scenes.  In other words, the attention of that area is thoroughly monitored and close attention with minimal distractions are paid to it.  I am from 13th Congressional District where we have “Parts” of Detroit as part of it.  Detroit should have never been compromised to have left some of it’s geographic parts, namely 138,000 + square miles out of the drawn 13th congressional map.  That was an absolute backwards planning all these years.  We all know that Detroit is the largest city in Michigan.  We also know that it has patches of good land with beautiful and rich property value and very bad land with condemned property value.  This comes from careless artist who decided that Detroit shall be considered as a “Whole” and never decided.  We also have shared our 13th congressional district with other cities who just do not share the same traditional values as we Detroiters share daily in our everyday local communities.  It’s called “Poverty” “Homelessness “ “Crime” “High Prison Rate” “Poor Education “ “Out dated School Materials” “ Lack of Resources “ “ Lack of Black Owned Business”.  When you think of Detroit.... “Black” comes to mind.  Why is that?  I’ll tell you why.  Detroit has over 70% of it’s population being of black descent.  That’s over half of it’s City’s population.  When drawing these lines, we MUST consider that very broad detail.  We need new artist, ones who sit down in the same room and assist with the 13 redistribution commissioners and draw together.  We need non racist, non bias persons to draw these lines.  We need regular everyday ordinary people who love their life and the lives of others whether they are “Black or White” “Rich or Poor” “Republican or Democrat “.  As long as those people who are drawing the lines do so like their life depends on it.  We need seasoned people who have lived long enough to know what went wrong and or is wrong now with the current map of districts combined.  We need honesty and integrity drawn in these line making decisions.  We need people with wisdom and understanding who knows how it feels to be left out of planning and development.  We as Detroiters need better representation to help our city thrive.  We cannot thrive partnered up with the wrong choice of other cities who walk a different line than Detroiters.  We need better Congressional leaders who actually care about the people’s needs to start listening to us on a daily basis and not just at election time.  The entire City of Detroit MUST be kept together inside of the new re-districting lines in order to get that thorough “Crime Scene Investigation “ mentioned in the beginning of my statement.  If we take a closer look, we will see that not only Detroit suffers as a community of poverty and lack of good congressional representation, but so does Highland Park, Inkster, Romulus, Taylor, Wayne, Lincoln Park, Redford, Farmington Hills, Southfield, Oak Park, and a few more cities combined.  I do not feel that Dearborn or Dearborn Hgts should be partners with Detroit in it’s re districting plans.  Those two cities are rich communities that make all of the cities named above feel like we are all from two different worlds.  When drawing the lines this time around, do NOT leave some of Detroit out from planning but include all of Detroit together inside of the same congressional district.  I leave you all with this, no matter how near or far you draw these new lines to include or subtract other cities, just remember, it doesn’t end with new lines, we must elect Congressional leaders who care and love their job well enough to request the right amount of funding and then actually use the funding to make for better districts.  I truly thank all of you for considering me to participate in this re-districting forum.  I will now work on a new map with new lines drawn to better serve you with my idea of a better congressional district which in return will make for a better Michigan as a whole.

897,written,,,Start with a computer program,"Hello members of the redistricting commission, It seems that the logical first step in this process would be to use a computer program to plot out geographic areas of approximate correct population for a voting district and then tweak the boundaries to follow town, city, county lines where feasible.  Keep it objective! Thank you, Marianne O'Connor Farmington Hills, MI"
898,written,,,Equity for communities of color,"As a justice advocate for Peoples of Color and Indigenous Peoples, it is crucial to me that all Peoples of Color and Indigenous Peoples are absolutely  fairly represented in the Redistricting in Michigan!!   For far too long the elite areas have been OVER Represented  and had elite Republican representation,  with legislative policies and decisions contrary to the best interests of People's of Color and Indigenous Peoples!  Please draw districts and boundaries that are fair to all! "
899,written,,,Keep it Local. Keep it Fair.,"I am encouraged that our state is pursuing an independent group to fairly redraw redistrict lines. One important outcome is that our elected officials are chosen by localized communities. That is to say, that my representative should not also represent a community a hundred miles away. For example, I live in Wyoming and my representative also represents Pentwater—well north of my community. As you can imagine, lakeshore and rural Pentwater constituents’ needs are much different than those of the overwhelmingly urban and suburban Wyoming and Grand Rapids residents.   Keep it localized. Keep it fair."
900,written,,,suggestions for Federal districts,"I would like to suggest when District 3 is re drawn that Grand Rapids be grouped with Muskegon or Lowell - I think along the Interstate highway corridors makes more sense then the vertical current District 3.   Also, the I-94 corridor should also be respected.  Such as Kalamazoo, Battle Creek, Jackson, Benton Harbor have more in common culturally then Grand Rapids. Historically they have always been working towns.  I grew up in Battle Creek and had never been to Grand Rapids until I moved here. I had been to Kalamazoo, Jackson, Lansing many many times.   "
901,written,,,Err on the side of equity,"My geographic area is Washtenaw County, where the shared identity of residents is a connection to a rich variety of higher education and/or research institutions including University of Michigan, Eastern Michigan University, and Washtenaw Community College. We come from diverse religious, cultural, racial, and socioeconomic backgrounds but generally share values of acceptance, tolerance, and working together for the common good.  My community is weakened by anyone in the state who advocates continuing partisan gerrymandering, restricting voting rights and access, or preventing equity. And anyone who embraces white supremacy and/or religious supremacy.   I urge you to start fresh, drawing brand new maps from scratch rather than simply adjusting the existing maps. The old maps are exactly what Michiganders resoundingly voted we don’t want!  Act with intention to enfranchise, rather than disenfranchise, those who historically have been under-represented. Strive to redress systematic racial and cultural inequities such as redlining and building highways down the midline of some communities. Empower communities that have lacked the power of equal representation, and draw lines that will allow their voices to be heard. Err on the side of equity, not history when you are making decisions.   Aim for compact districts that unite communities rather than divide them.  Draw maps that everyone can clearly see are straightforward and sensible. Draw lines that give citizens confidence in the fairness of the process. For example, as one Detroit public comment speaker suggested, consider limiting the number of corners to 4 per district to avoid crazy shapes and complicated configurations. Or, as another speaker suggested, consider keeping existing municipal boundaries intact as much as possible.   Consider following the lead of other states and/or experts who have successfully identified ways to defend against partisan gerrymandering:  https://www.fastcompany.com/90467795/why-ai-alone-cant-solve-the-scourge-of-gerrymandering   https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/media/2018/October/wes-pegden-gerrymandering   https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-maps/   https://phys.org/news/2017-11-algorithm-combat-gerrymandering.html  Thank you for your time and efforts to ensure Michigan’s new district boundaries are drawn fairly.

902,written,,,Gerrymandered Apartheid,"Free and fair elections are the bedrock upon which democracies are built. Gerrymandering undermines the very foundation of democracies. The creation of the 14th Federal Congressional district in Michigan was an act of ‘creative’ district drawing that produced a serpent shaped district every bit as repugnant as Elbridge Gerry’s salamander from which the term ‘gerrymander’ is derived. The 14th Congressional District is gerrymandered apartheid.   My parents built the first house in Lathrup Village after WW II in 1946. I lived in Lathrup Village part or full time every year from 1951 until 2012. I maintain close ties to Lathrup as a member of community organizations and volunteering to do the showcase at the city hall every month. Lathrup Village is part of my DNA.    Until the dawn of the 21st century, the Congressional districts of which Lathrup Village was a part were drawn on a north-south basis. With redistributions over the years, the names changed but not the north-south orientation.   By the turn of the century, both Lathrup Village and Southfield became predominately African American neighborhoods. Had the tradition of drawing north-south boundaries been continued, the communities of Lathrup Village and Southfield would have provided a strong African American input to Congress from Oakland County by joining these voters to predominantly caucasian cities such as Beverly Hills and Birmingham. Instead, the Republicans started with the predominately black city of Pontiac, moved west in a crescent-like formation to take the sections of West Bloomfield and Farmington Hills with a notable black presence, and then went south to place Lathrup and Southfield within the new district before veering south of 8 Mile Road into Detroit. This was in effect racial cleansing to minimize the impact of the black vote in Oakland County.   Sections 4 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 were to prevent racial gerrymandering in which minority voters were spread thinly across electoral districts leaving them with too few voters to elect the candidate of their choice. Majority-minority districts, however, have  created the unintended consequence of diluting the influence of minority voters elsewhere. This is precisely what the Republicans did in creating the 14th District, now one of the 3 most gerrymandered districts in America. A Lego model of the 14th is used to teach the art of the gerrymander in political science classes at universities across America. The Republicans know that the African American community largely votes Democratic. By distorting the intent of the Voting Rights Act, the Republicans packed the Democrats into the 14th under the guise of benefitting African American voters. It is a sham.   Please ensure that in your deliberations you restore the north-south orientation in Oakland County. Fair elections start with fair electoral maps.      Diane Anderson           "
903,written,,,A humble comment for your consideration,"Hello dear members of the Redistricting Commission, thank you for the work you are doing; An extremely difficult task no doubt, but a very important task as well. I am grateful for your attention and consideration. My name is Mike Baynai, I live in Caledonia with my wife Donna. We pay taxes to Gaines Township and are in the Kentwood School District. I am a Presbyterian pastor and serve my community in a number of ways, including as a police and fire chaplain for the city of Kentwood. I love my community and the people who live in it. It is my ""community of interest"".  Former Michigan Supreme Court Justice Stephen Markman sums up my position regarding your work very well when stating that ""community of interests historically and by court precedent have meant voting boundaries based on township, cities and counties"".  The article went on to say, ""Former Michigan Supreme Court Justice Stephen Markman is urging the state's new redistricting commission against using racial, ethnic or religious groups as a determiner of the state's new voting boundaries for the 2022 election."" (Detroit News, July 2, 2021 - Beth LeBlanc). That is my hope and even prayer. May God bless you as you serve the fine people of this state. Thank you. P.S. We attended the Grand Rapids public meeting but left at 7:00pm as we were numbers 73 and 74."
904,written,,,Redistricting of Shiawassee County,"Good afternoon,  I’m here to recommend how redistricting should be done regarding Shiawassee County which makes up the vast majority of the 85th House District that currently includes 6 townships from the southwest corner of Saginaw County, and regarding the 24th Michigan Senate District that includes Shiawassee, Clinton, and Eaton Counties, and 5 townships from Ingham County, and lastly Shiawassee County as part of the 4th U.S. Congressional District.  Shiawassee County historically has been kept whole for redistricting purposes for the Michigan House and Senate Districts and a U.S. Congressional District meeting the redistricting criteria of Compact-ness, Contiguity, and the Polsby-Popper Score requirements. It also should rate a high Reock Score keeping to the area of the smallest possible circle redistricting requirement.  Shiawassee County also meets the redistricting criteria of Competitiveness, Incumbency, Packing and Cracking, and Partisan Fairness as historically the county votes in a way that can result in candidates from either party winning.  In the spirit of the Communities of Interest redistricting criteria that requires “populations that share cultural or historical characteristics or economic interests” be taken into consideration for redistricting, Shiawassee County shares a common culture and historical background with common economic interests. Shiawassee County is primarily rural with agriculture, small business and businesses that are automotive related making up the primary economic interests.   Shiawassee County has a population of 68,000 which is close to the 77-91,000 population require-ment to be a Michigan House District by itself. The County is historically joined with a few townships from an adjoining county of similar cultural, historical, and economic interests to make up a Michigan House District.  To redistrict Shiawassee County in way that would divide it up electorally would artificially divide a population that would be detrimental historically, culturally and economically. I urge you to keep Shiawassee County as primarily its own Michigan House District and to keep it whole for purposes of creating a Michigan Senate District and a U.S. Congressional District by combing it with other counties of similar cultural, historical, and economic interests.  Thank you,  Stacie L. Zaleski    "
905,written,,,Kentwood MI Problem with the Current Sys,"Hello.  My name is Ron Draayer.  I live in Kent County in the City of Kentwood, which is a suburb that is connected to Grand Rapids.  My home in Kentwood is only a few hundred yards from the city of Grand Rapids.  Thank you for allowing me to address the Commission.  I would like to give you two examples of problems with the current system.  First of all, as a resident of Kentwood, I am currently in the 2nd Congressional District.  This district places the residents of Kentwood in the same Congressional District as people in Ludington, Michigan who live approximately 100 miles from Kentwood in a lakeshore community that is very different than those of us living in a suburb next to Grand Rapids.  Meanwhile, almost all other residents of Kent County are in the 3rd Congressional District.    Many of the concerns of the people of Kentwood are not always fully represented when we are lumped in with other communities that are more rural and primarily centered around small cities.   The current system is not fair to the people of Kentwood.  A second reason why the current boundaries are unfair to residents of Kentwood is because of the 72nd Michigan House of Representatives district.  Currently, residents of Kentwood, which has over 50,000 citizens, are in the same district as some people from Allegan County which is primarily a rural county.  Having a district that crosses county lines causes confusion because of the vast differences in services provided by Kent County as opposed to Allegan County.  Also, the 72nd district was constructed in such a way that Democrats have very little if any chance of succeeding in elections.  I ran as a Democrat in 2018 for the 72nd House district as did Lily Cheng-Shulting in 2020.  Both of us ran aggressive campaigns and both of us did very well in the City of Kentwood.  But, because of the current construction of this district, the Republican candidate was easily re-elected because of the predominance of Republican voters in the Allegan portion of the district.  The boundaries of the 72nd district are an example of elections in Michigan that are not competitive and have foregone conclusions before people ever start voting.  Thank you again for the opportunity to speak to you, and for your work on the Commission.  Thank you  Ronald Draayer Ron.draayer77@gmail.com    PH:  616-460-6461 "
906,written,,,Testimony from Newton Township,"Hello my name is Garland Piper and I live in Newton Township, which is part of Calhoun County.  I was raised in Climax Township, which is part of Kalamazoo County.  I have lived the majority of my life in rural Newton Township but have also spent time attending college at Western Michigan University and working in the Metropolitan Detroit area.   Newton Township is a rural, conservative predominate farming community.  The farming community is a more simple way of living, where most individuals know their neighbors and protect their neighbors and their property.  Newton Township has minimal crime compared to the larger surrounding metropolitan areas.  My family and I attend a church in Calhoun County.  The church is large enough to support the many challenges facing the surrounding communities, but intimate enough to meet the spiritual needs of the individual.  Our church believes in community outreach and draws members from the surrounding townships and villages.  Our church brings people of all walks of life together to form a community of volunteers and believers.  The core beliefs of our church are community focused. Agriculture is the primary industry in Newton Township and Calhoun County.  Food manufacturing and light automotive manufacturing comprise the other significant industries within our current district.  These industries tie the townships of our present districts together into on homogeneous community where the Calhoun County resources can be used together to support the constituents common goals and objectives.  The current district boundaries allow our smaller communities to have a greater impact locally without the negative influence of larger surrounding municipalities.   I have spent the past 27 years working for various automotive suppliers in Calhoun, Jackson and Wayne Counties.  There are big differences between rural agricultural Calhoun county and Industrial Wayne County.  Wayne County has some of the largest populations and largest companies within the state and country.  The constituent needs of these larger industrialized counties are significantly different than the rural agricultural counties such as Calhoun County.  Although, Wayne County isn’t likely to be redistricted with Calhoun County, I mention these differences because I could certainly see an option of redistricting Calhoun County with Kalamazoo County.  Kalamazoo County is more heavily industrialized, similar to Wayne County with Healthcare associated industrial companies leading the way.  Through my years, I have experienced the differences between rural Michigan and metropolitan Michigan.  Cities such as Kalamazoo have a larger population density, more governmental needs and a huge college presence.  The ideals and values of Kalamazoo are far more liberal and don’t adequately reflect the majority of Newton Township residents.  These three issues, along with many others make it my desire to keep our district as a rural agricultural district  "
907,written,,ogemaw,District needs to be neutral & fair,"There has been reporting and speculation that the Commission is focused on drawing districts based on race, ethnicity, religion, and other suspect classes, under the pretext that they are ""communities of interests."" I am not saying that the reporting is accurate; I certainly hope that it is not. Drawing districts based on race, ethnicity, religion, and other suspect classes is plain and simple gerrymandering. The Commission was created to end gerrymandering, especially gerrymandering based on race, ethnicity, religion, political beliefs, and other suspect classes.   The district maps need to reflect reasonable looking shapes that are based on county, city, and township boundaries. Drawing districts based on municipal boundaries promotes a fair, neutral, and non-partisan redistricting plan. Every resident of Michigan identifies with the municipality that they reside in. Their municipality is their community. The commission even encourages all commenters to provide the city/county that the commenters reside in or identify with because that is their community. Communities of interest are best defined by county, city, township, and municipal boundaries. In short, districts should be drawn based on county, city, township, and municipal boundaries because it is the most neutral, equitable, and fair. Let the voters chose their politicians, use municipal boundaries to draw the district lines. "
908,written,,battle creek city,District 3 reconfiguration,"As a citizen of Battle Creek, it seems illogical to be included with Grand Rapids as part of district 3.  Although Rep. Justin Amash offered opportunities for citizen input, the interests of Grand Rapids and Battle Creek don't mesh.  BC is closer to Kalamazoo; we share an airport; WMU has a major presence in our community; Ft. Custer serves both Battle Creek and Kalamazoo.  Even Channel 3 gives news from both communities.  With BC leaning conservative and Kalamazoo progressive, both points of view are represented.  Pair them in the new reconfiguration of voting districts.  It makes much more sense. Thank you for your time, Frank M. Skeltis Battle Creek"
909,written,,,Our communities are diverse,"The Commission appears to be very focused on communities of interest that encompass race, ethnicity, religion (Communities of interest may include, but shall not be limited to, populations that share cultural or historical characteristics or economic interests).  I believe we are losing sight of what actually makes a community.  By narrowing down a COI with these categories, you are actually making it political when your goal appears to be the opposite.  Communities of interest should be the area we each consider ‘home’.  How would any single Representative be attentive to EVERY member of a community unless you are handpicking the people who will fill that bucket? Our Representatives lead each district to the best of their ability.  They may have a majority of farmers, city folk, or suburbanites, etc. All walks of life / interests live in ALL communities and they are not always going to be equal groups.  That’s okay.  We all don’t need to be equal and we don’t all need the same things. To assume a Representative will be in 100% agreement with everyone in their district is impossible. Trying to be fair is one thing, but forcing a COI into a tight package is not constructive. My need / interest is likely different from my next-door neighbor or the contractor across town or the farmer five miles away.  The only way to get close to having a Representative understand and fulfill the needs of all of their constituents is if we had 110 different Representatives and each citizen in Michigan got to pick which one best represented THEIR needs / interests.  Everyone of those 110 Representatives would have constituents to represent in 83 counties across the state. Not all members of an area are going to have the same views, interests & opinions, etc. as their elected Representative.   Just as a group of employees are not going to have the same views, interests, & opinions as their boss. Hopefully, our boss or our Representative will do an excellent job of representing all their people on the basis of what’s best for the office / community as a whole.  We all must learn to adapt and get along.  In our communities. In our cities.  In our counties.  Thank you for your time.  "
910,written,,,Difficult job,"Hello members of the board. My name is Shannon Faas and I live in the panhandle of Wyoming. I listen to all of the testimony tonight because I wanted to get an idea of the pulse of the community. I don’t envy your job because it’s going to be an arduous one. In listening to some of the speakers I agree that they need to be fair and balanced when looking at dividing lines. One speaker spoke of Grand Rapids having two representatives but one being outside Grand Rapids and one being inside Grand Rapids. This doesn’t work for them what would work would be having someone to represent north and someone to represent South Grand Rapids. They are two very distinct communities with completely different needs. Along the same lines mashing up different areas of different cities does not make sense. In the panhandle we are Grandville School district but yet Wyoming city. This doesn’t make sense for us because we are really not in the heart of Wyoming, we are in Grandville. Batching like communities together such as Wyoming and Kenwood, East Grand Rapids and Forest Hills, Jenison and Grandville, Will help maintain the collective voice. If you take a small community such as Granville and combine it with southern Grand Rapids, they’re just too different and some voices will be lost. Same goes for taking a small portion of South Grand Rapids and putting it with Wyoming and Grandville. The South Grand Rapids voice will be lost. When drawing up the redistricting lines careful attention needs to be taken to keep areas with similar interest in similar needs together. The one person said if you put Grandville with Grand Rapids then Grandville‘s personality would go away. Making sure that everyone’s voices are heard is what’s most important. Putting unlike communities together will disenfranchised some voters. Again I don’t envy your job because it will be a very difficult one. Not 100% of everyone affected will be happy, but making sure that every voice has the opportunity to be heard will be the best. Someone spoke of the six cities and how the outlying communities are not like Grand Rapids which is true. Please when thinking about how to redistrict, make sure you put like communities together therefore they have like needs. Jenison and Granville do not need as much money as downtown Grand Rapids does, so they would not take up as much of the Michigan budget. But batching Grandville  and Grand Rapids together like the one person said Grandville would get nothing even if they only needed a little. Not to disk lewd the lake shore communities, but I agreed with Makatawa as well, splitting them up makes it double the work to get the same job done.  Please be careful and best of luck. Shannon "

I’ve been a Shiawassee County resident for decades and I want to make sure our voice is heard in our state house and state senate districts.  Right now, we are in the 85th state house district which includes all of Shiawassee County and a few townships in western Saginaw County.  We are a mostly rural community with many agricultural communities and small towns.   We have specific interests and needs that other more populated areas do not share with us.   Our state senate district currently includes Eaton, Clinton, and Shiawassee Counties.   We also share very similar interests among our three counties.   We share economic, cultural, and historical interests that we do not share with many areas of our state.  We also share similar infrastructures within our communities that are very different than other communities and their needs.   Keeping our counties and townships together – as they are currently are – will also meet the criteria of compactness and contiguity, which are now guidelines the commission must follow.  We see our community of interest, full of small towns, farms, and rural townships that together make a close knit community.  We hope that you will keep these comments in mind when you draw the maps for the next ten years.   Thank you  Bruce Hudson "

914,written,,"kalamazoo,battle creek,calhoun",SW Michigan Congressional District," Thank you, commissioners, for allowing me to speak to you. My name is Cory King. I am a voter in the 6th congressional district here in Kalamazoo.  The reason I am submitting this testimony is because I live in a community that has been negatively impacted by gerrymandering. Historically before Kalamazoo was drawn into its current district after the 1990-91 redistricting, Kalamazoo county and Calhoun county were both in the same congressional district and had been in the same district for decades during the 1970s and 1980s. Back then, the district was much more competitive with both Republicans and Democrats alternating holding the congressional seat between 1955 to 1991 (it was called the 3rd district at the time). I believe that this historic wrong needs to be corrected. I would like to draw your attention to the common communities of interests that Kalamazoo and Calhoun counties share. Both counties share a common metro area with the cities of Kalamazoo and Battle Creek. Both counties are connected by a major highway (I-94) and residents of both counties use this highway daily to commute as many residents in Calhoun county work in Kalamazoo and vice versa as both Battle Creek and Kalamazoo are just 20 miles apart. There are many residents in both counties that work for major businesses in the other county. There are many residents in Calhoun county who work for companies and institutions in Kalamazoo county like Pfizer and Western Michigan University and there are Kalamazoo residents who work for companies and institutions in Calhoun county like Kellogg’s and the veteran’s hospital.   Both counties share a major airport with the “Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport” which is heavily used by residents of both counties. Kalamazoo and Calhoun counties are both served by Bronson and Borgess hospitals with both hospitals having health care facilities in both communities. Both counties are also served by Western Michigan University which is the biggest four-year university in this area. Many residents of Calhoun county who have attended Kellogg Community College have transferred the credits that they received there to WMU to get a bachelor’s degree while being able to remain living in Calhoun county. Both Kalamazoo and Calhoun counties also share similar racial makeup. Kalamazoo county’s African-American population makes up 9.7% of the county’s overall population and Calhoun county’s African-American population makes up 10.7% of the counties overall population. In counties that neighbor both Kalamazoo and Calhoun counties the population of African-American residents make up less than 5% of their overall population.   Both counties also share the same media markets with residents from both counties getting their local news from the same television and print/digital media organizations. Most of the Michigan residents east of Calhoun county share a different media market than the residents of Calhoun county do. I will conclude this testimony where I began with it. In the early 1990s, Kalamazoo and Calhoun counties were drawn into separate congressional districts after being in the same district for decades. This wrong is long overdue for a correction and both of these communities that share so many things in common, should once again have the same U.S. Representative in Congress.  Thank you for your time and consideration."
915,written,,"berrien,lakeshore ,tourism,lgbtq+",Written Testimony of Kim Jorgensen Gane,"My name is Kim Jorgensen Gane. My husband and I have raised two generations of kids in St. Joseph in Berrien County. I’ve been a restaurateur, a realtor, I ran communications for Chokwe Pitchford—a very compelling then 21-year-old Black man who ran for the 79th state house district in 2020. I’m also a citizen appointee to the sustainability committee for the City of St. Joe. I, too, want to thank the commission and say to you, “Obiwan Kinobi, you are our only hope.”   It’s no accident that current maps lump Berrien County with two ultra white rural counties with which we have little in common. This hurts them, too, as we’ve heard in public comments, and it hurts the sustainability of our region, especially our lakeshore communities impacted by extreme climate events, resulting erosion, and a seasonal economy related to the ups & downs of tourism, but lacking many of the state and federal supports available to agricultural communities.   We face routine frustration that much of our district is so heavily influenced, socially and politically, by northwest Indiana media. I want my representatives to understand and support my and my community’s Michigan interests & concerns.  But mostly, I’m troubled that current maps make my district overwhelmingly white and heteronormative. We’ve worked for years to ensure that LGBTQ Michiganders are included in Michigan’s Elliott Larsen civil rights protections.   It makes good sense for racially and socially diverse communities like Niles and St. Joe/Benton Harbor in Berrien County, and South Haven and Paw Paw in Van Buren County to be in the same district to allow voters of color and LGBTQ communities to finally have a fair shot at representation. Because listening to them, considering their experience and ideas, too, will make our whole state work better for hardworking families and individuals.  What impacts our communities, impacts our counties, impacts our region, impacts our state. It’s 2021, for goodness sakes. If a global pandemic, a test insurrection at our own state capitol, a kidnapping plot against our Governor, and a long needed racial reckoning has taught us anything, at a minimum, we should all be able to agree that #women and people of color and those in the LGBTQ community Are, in fact, People, too.   By design, we can’t ever hope to achieve or retain those most basic of rights for all with our current gerrymandered districts."

917,written,,,The need to start maps from scratch,"Good evening and thank you all for your service to fair and equitable democracy. As you’ve learned by now - this is no simple task. My name is Jeff Winston. I am a resident of Grand Rapids and have the honor to serve as the chairperson of the 3rd Congressional District Democratic Committee.   By simply following the seven guiding criteria – the importance of keeping Kent County wholly in the 3rd Congressional District should be clear. Now, here we are - after over 30 years of unfair, partisan advantage by a political party that seems afraid of competition. So afraid in fact - Kent County even had GOP straw candidate scheme in 2012 in an attempt to avoid competition.  Public disclosures and recent lawsuits have uncovered the depth of the 2010 Republican redistricting scheme. These are the maps we are currently saddled with. During the lawsuit discovery process GOP internal emails from a GOP legislative staffer discussing drawing districts to “cram ALL the Dem garbage” into four southeast Michigan districts in order to meet the “obvious objective – putting Dems in a Dem district and reps in a GOP district.”  Another GOP staffer joking about the oddly shaped 9th Congressional District in a corner of Macomb County that jutted up “between Mound and Vandyke down to 15 mile … perfect. it’s giving the finger” to incumbent Rep. Sander Levin, D-Royal Oak.  GOP strategist Bob LaBrant rejected a map that would give Republicans a 10-4 majority in the state congressional delegation, writing in an email on May 26, 2011: “We need for legal and PR purposes a good-looking map that did not look like an obvious gerrymander.”  As you are well aware, this Commission was approved by the voters by over 61% of the vote specifically to end the type of partisan thumbs on the scales of democracy like we saw from the Michigan GOP in 2010. Keeping this in mind, I wish to stress the absolute importance of starting your mapping process from scratch. There are no “good lines” to keep or “bad lines” that can be fixed.  https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/how-shadow-republican-group-gerrymandered-michigan-sparking-backlash "

Although it is wonderful to try to keep communities of interest together, sometimes you're going to have to decide on how you're going to split these communities when necessary to comply with the districting law. Please attempt to combine those communities with other like communities of interest. I know this seems obvious but I notices that everyone seems to be focused on keeping their particular community together, regardless of the realities of the law.  Please do not mix unlike communities for diversity sake.  The long term consequence of such action is the disenfranchisement of the less powerful or less affluent part of the mixed community."

I'd like to point out that this suggestion is terrible for Michigan State districts.   Let me remind you that these are POLITICAL districts which must represent the public interests in those districts. State districts are mostly concerned with police, roads, schools and caring for our elderly.   The State revenue is spent on K-12 schools (25.2%), higher education(4.3%), public assistance(0.4%), Medicaid(30.2%), Corrections(4.2%), Transportation(6.9%) and Other miscellaneous things(28.8%) Most of the state concerns are relative to your home and your home community, not the community where your job is located.

Second, I have come to the conclusion that systems in our institutions are not “broken” and require “fixing”.  In fact, the systems work exactly as designed for the benefit of those who designed them.  Unfortunately,  many systems have not been designed with equity and fairness for all and that is the case with our current districting.  Therefore, this process should start from scratch and not attempt to fix the broken districts in place today.  Finally, as a community,  as a resident of Wyoming,  the community needs here are more similar to those in Grand Rapids and Kent County.  They are not similar to people living in Pentwater.  This project should incorporate community connectivity as much as possible. Thank you. Patrick"
926,written,,,Downriver Districts,"Thank you very much to the three commission members who came to the extra scheduled town hall meeting on June 14, 2021 in River Rouge.  It was a very informative meeting that showed the cohesiveness of the Downriver communities.  I learned a lot and came to better appreciate the history of the “Triple City” of Ecorse, River Rouge and the 48217 zip code of Southwest Detroit. I am Mrs. Deborah Bloomfield.  I have been a resident of Wyandotte since my marriage to a native of Wyandotte 47 years ago.  I was on the Board of Directors for the non-profit Downriver Recycling Center from 1982 until it closed in 1997.  I have also been very active in the Catholic Church having belonged to three different parishes in the area during that time, as well as involved in various other local civic activities. According to the information given at the River Rouge Town Hall meeting, the recommended district populations should be: US Congress: 711,000 Michigan Senate:  212,400 to 263,000 Michigan House of Representatives: approximately 80,000  I relied upon the population numbers available from data.census.gov as recommended by the commission members at the town hall meeting.. The Downriver communities of Allen Park, Brownstown, Ecorse, Flat Rock, Gibraltar, Grosse Ile, Lincoln Park, Melvindale, River Rouge, Riverview, Rockwood, Southgate, Taylor, Trenton, Woodhaven, Wyandotte, and SW Detroit (48217) are compact.  People living in these communities seamlessly travel from one community to the next for work, shopping, church, recreation, and school.   Michigan Senate boundaries: The 17 Downriver communities have a total population of just over 327,000.  That makes about 100, 000 more than a Michigan Senate seat.  I recommend that the northern portion of Downriver be one Michigan Senate seat of about 218,500 people. The southern, more rural portion of Downriver (Rockwood, Gibraltar and Flat Rock) and the south tier of western Wayne County (Romulus, Huron Twp., Belleville, and Van Buren Twp. (totaling almost 99,000) should be joined with Monroe County (approximately 150,000), for another Michigan Senate seat serving 249,000 people. My proposed boundaries: https://districtr.org/plan/27171 Michigan House Districts:  The Michigan House Districts suggested by Craig Farrand of the News Herald appear reasonable and logical. U.S. Senate Districts:  I am very concerned that Wayne County is currently divided into parts of four Congressional districts:  11, 12, 13, and 14 with serpentine boundaries which extend into other counties in three of the districts. The City of Detroit with a total population of 670,052 is almost enough to be an entire Congressional District.  I recommend that the 48217 section of SW Detroit (population 8,210) be included with the Downriver Congressional seat rather than with Detroit.  For the Detroit congressional seat, the towns of Highland Park (10,867) and Hamtramck (21,822) should be added for a total Detroit Congressional  seat population of 694,531. The Downriver communities should be added to the southwestern Wayne County communities, the entire county of Monroe. https://districtr.org/plan/27180 "
927,written,,,Julie's written comment to ICRC Michigan,"Dear MICRC, I'm a resident of Cass County & also a citizen of the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians. I wish to highlight how my communities interact with and rely heavily on two adjacent counties of Berrien and Van Buren for a variety of reasons.  Our tribal nation's base campus is in Dowagiac. We operate 3 casinos here in SW Michigan - Dowagiac (Cass Co), Hartford (Van Buren), and New Buffalo (Berrien). We operate several non-gaming businesses that provide many, many jobs locally. We use local vendors whenever possible for all of our businesses.  Some of our tribal employees travel to work from our citizen housing complexes in Hartford and Dowagiac.  We also have medical, dental, and optical clinics in Dowagiac as well as a medical & dental clinic in Benton Harbor (Berrien County) that serves the general public.  Our tribal police are cross-deputized to work in collaboration with other local departments in Cass, Berrien & Van Buren counties and various tribal departments do outreach in the area such as the Education Dept coordinates Title VI programs at schools within our MI 4-county service area that also includes Allegan county.    Berrien & Cass counties are both served by Indiana TV stations and regional newspaper - The Herald Palladium in Benton Harbor for local news.   It, therefore, makes complete sense to me to combine Cass, Berrien & Van Buren counties into our voting district. "
928,written,,,Keep Communities Intact,"Please keep communities (counties, cities, and townships) intact when you draw the district boundary lines. Gerrymandering, dividing, and carving into municipal boundaries based on political beliefs, race, ethnicity, religion, and other suspect classes will lead to unfair voting results. The district maps need to reflect reasonable looking shapes that are based on county, city, and township boundaries. Drawing districts based on municipal boundaries promotes a fair, neutral, and non-partisan redistricting plan. Let the voters chose their politicians, use municipal boundaries to draw the district lines. "

930,written,,,LINC UP Public Comment,"I am submitting a comment on behalf of LINC UP, an affordable housing and community empowerment organization working to achieve racial equity in Grand Rapids. We advocate for policies that increase opportunities in the neighborhoods we serve. LINC UP has identified its focus area as the southeast and southwest sides of Grand Rapids, Wyoming, and the Grandville Ave Corridor (Directionally our area of focus is Wealthy St to the North, 36th St to the South, and 1 mile east of S Division Ave to the East and 1 mile west of S. Division Ave to the West.   We appreciate the State of Michigan for placing a high priority on Communities of Interest. How the maps are drawn currently continues to segment and separate communities of color when it comes to voting, and that must change if we are going to achieve racial equity in Grand Rapids and Kent County. I'm here to urge you to start the process of drawing State House maps in Kent County by creating a district with the most possible People of Color in a single district within Grand Rapids. People of Color deal mostly with City services -- law enforcement, courts, social services, roads, -- so we want this district to encompass most of Grand Rapids Ward 3 and surrounding areas. These are two strong communities of interest -- residents of the largest city in the county and the second largest in the state -- and Blacks, Hispanics, Asian / Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans. Such a district should be centered around the 49507 zip code, where our office is located. That's the zip code in our area with the largest POC population and it has unique issues concerning economics, culture, history.   We want you to create a district where a person of color has a strong likelihood of winning and representing us in Lansing. There hasn't been a POC state rep from Grand Rapids since 2010 when Rev. Bob Dean held an earlier 75th district. We understand that it is impossible to create a  POC majority Voting Age Population district, but we urge you to create a POC majority Total Population.  Please, give the Black, Hispanic, and other POC people in Grand Rapids a strong chance to be represented in Lansing by someone from our community. This can be achieved by drawing a map that combines the 49507 zip code of SE GR with the Grandville corridor of SW GR.   Additionally, we believe the 7 core cities of Metro Grand Rapids should be considered a community of interest where applicable.  Particularly the southern suburbs of Kentwood and Wyoming should be kept together when possible due to the similarities of demographics, economics, land use, and civic structure. These 7 core cities have much more in common with each other than the outlying rural areas and townships of Kent Co that they often get paired with. For example in the 110 state house districts, Wyoming is in its own district with Byron township and Kentwood is combined with Gaines Township. With COI's in mind, a better structure would be to group the townships together and combine the inner ring suburbs of Wyoming and Kentwood. "
931,written,,,Eureka township and Greenville,"Dear Commissioners,  I thank you for your service to the state of Michigan and all its residents in trying to establish more fair and less partisan representative political districts.   I live in Eureka Township of Montcalm county which has the city of Greenville within it. Due to gerrymandering, the city of Greenville appears like a gouge on the map, extracted from the charter township of Eureka, in which it sits. Greenville was assigned to Congressional District 4 which covers the rest of Montcalm county and more than a dozen counties to the north and east of us.  The remainder of Eureka township which encircles Greenville was assigned to Congressional District 3 with Kent county and counties south and west of us. This means that the people of Eureka township barely have representation, being unattached from its county as well as its home town. When Montcalm county Legislative Update sessions are held in Stanton, the county seat, the representative for District 3 has not even been invited. This unintended slight has yet to be remedied by the host group.  I am asking that Greenville and its township, Eureka, be included within one representative district. We are linked by school system, concerns for our community, economic development, common interests and geographic proximity.  Also for your consideration, I might make you aware of the link between Ionia and Montcalm counties. With the cities of Belding and Greenville just six miles apart, we share much in common. We are linked through social services organizations such as United Way, and our children of need are served by IM Kids, a third meal program distributed through the schools for both counties. We also share women’s shelter services through RAVE and services for the homeless through Have Mercy. The Montcalm-ionia Citizen Corps Program has volunteers from both counties, as does the Ionia-Montcalm chapter of FAN—Families Against Narcotics. We also share agriculture and rural community issues like health care access, farm labor, public transportation and broadband service. Both are counties with suburban areas as well, furnishing workers and adding to the economies of the larger cities of Grand Rapids and Lansing. It would seem appropriate for Ionia and Montcalm county to be linked for district representation. But since you have many things to consider in the districting process and there may be other reasons for Ionia and Montcalm not to share a district, I leave it to you.  My primary request is that Greenville and Eureka Township be included within the same Congressional District. Thank you.  Jan W Greenville, MI 48838 "
932,written,,,Redistricting Strategy #SquareDistricts,"Gerrymandering undermines democracy!! To avoid this practice, a general principle needs to be applied. * All districts should generally have square sides and reflect state population / by the number of districts. In Michigan at this time that means the state population of 10,084,442/13 districts would suggest each district should represent 775,726 people.   However, due to the inconsistent distribution of population There needs to be a few adjustments to reflect practicalities.    Instead of drawing all districts from scratch, why not build on the current county designations which are somewhat square sided. When the county has more than the number of in the district designation, portion the districts in county with straight lines.    Another practicality is that the 775,726 would lump nearly half the state into one district. Consequently, a couple of deviations seem appropriate: Artificially designate 2 districts for the Upper Peninsula and 2 district for the Norther half of the Lower Peninsula.    Then develop the remaining 9 districts across the counties in the lower part of the state, aggregating or dividing, as appropriate, based on county populations. This would be easy to understand and be fairly transparent, and easily adjusted as population distribution changes.           "

935,written,,"leelanau,grand traverse area,five counties together","Leelanau, GT, Benzie, Antrim, Kalkaska","The mission of the Leelanau Early Childhood Development Commission (LECDC.)  is to “provide families access to a high quality, comprehensive, accountable system of care and pre-school experience for children birth through age 5.”   Although our “home base” is Leelanau County, a peninsula hugged by the Grand Traverse Bay and Lake Michigan, our collaborating partners are in Grand Traverse, Benzie, Antrim, and Kalkaska Counties.  Much the same can be said of many organizations and businesses located in each of our five-counties.   We ask that our five counties be kept together as a “community of interest” as much as feasible in the current redistricting process.    The LECDC Board members are long term, and some life long, residents of Leelanau County. We are all active in our community and can say with certainty that we know the history, culture, economics and needs of our area.  We have a school superintendent, student support staff, a county commissioner, pre-school directors, early childhood specialists, entrepreneurs, small business owners, fruit farmers, a judge, members of our local family collaborative, members of our local chambers of commerce, members of our Latino and indigenous communities on our Board.  We appreciate all five counties with approximately 172,000 residents could be in one state senate district, but have too great a population to be in one state house district, and too small a population to be the sole composition of a single federal district. However, we believe these five counties share cultural and historical characteristics and economic interests and should be considered a “community of interest” and kept together along their county boundaries as much as possible when drawing the new district lines.  Our five counties have common bonds and comprise a “community of interest” because we share services, a school district, resources, transportation and the identity as being the broader Grand Traverse Bay Area.   Specifically, LECDC is working on the expansion of affordable, quality child care across the region. All five-counties have inadequate child care to provide for our growing work force. This five-county area has recently been awarded responsibility for the management of the Tri-Share pilot program to address the scarcity of child care in our region.     Also consider the following common bonds. A significant number residents of all five counties: •	travel to Grand Traverse County for work; •	utilize the hospital, doctors and pediatricians located in Grand Traverse County;   Further, we share educational, social service, agricultural and tourism resources: •	Northwest Education Services is a five-county region of Antrim, Benzie, Grand Traverse, Leelanau and Kalkaska schools.   •	Northwestern Community College is the area’s post-high school institution. •	Many local service agencies cover all, if not several, of these counties.  (e.g. Child Advocacy Center, United Way of Northwest Michigan, Northwest Community Action Agency, Great Start Collaborative Traverse Bay, Women’s Resource Center, Area Agency on Aging of Northwest Michigan, Substance Free Coalition of NW Michigan) •	All five counties lack adequate, affordable housing and work in collaboration with each other on initiatives to address this concern. •	Our local circuit court jurisdiction is comprised of Grand Traverse, Leelanau and Antrim counties.   •	A public transportation system connects Leelanau with Grand Traverse Counties. Actually, the only land routes out of Leelanau County are through Grand Traverse or Benzie County.   •	The Traverse Area Regional Trail (TART) trail goes through Leelanau, Antrim and Grand Traverse Counties. •	These five-counties all rely on the financial rewards of northern Michigan tourism.  •	Leelanau and Benzie are the home of the Sleeping Bear National Park.  •	Grand Traverse, Leelanau, Antrim and Benzie counties share shoreline, sit at the basin of the Grand Traverse Bay and/or the shoreline of Lake Michigan.   •	Area water protection organizations interact in these shoreline counties.  •	Leelanau, Grand Traverse, Antrim and Benzie comprise the majority of commercial cherries grown in Michigan and 55% of Michigan wine grapes are grown in Leelanau and Grand Traverse Counties.   The broader lower northwest Michigan counties we have included in our state senate and federal house map proposals also share several bonds. Our counties are known for year round tourism: beaches in the summer, skiing in the winter and hunting, camping and the color tour in the fall. The counties that we have included in our map proposals are along main transportation arteries in the northern western Lower Peninsula, namely US 131 and 127. These counties host four major post-graduate institutions: Northwestern Michigan Community College, North Central Michigan College, Central Michigan College, and Kirtland College.    We are all Michiganders, but our five-county region shares so much in common, but not state house and state senate districts.  Currently, Leelanau, Grand Traverse, Antrim Kalkaska and Benzie counties are spread over four house districts (the 101st, 103rd, 104th and 106th) and two different senate districts (the 35th and 37th). Our current federal district is the vast geographic District 1 that encompasses 25,000 square miles, all of the 15 Upper Peninsula counties and 17 Lower Peninsula counties.   We are submitting suggestions for state house and state senate. We are also submitting two federal house suggestion: one in the Lower Peninsula and along the west side of the state and one encompassing the Upper Peninsula and along the east coast of the state. Again, we ask that our five counties, Leelanau, Grand Traverse, Benzie, Antrim, and Kalkaska be kept together as a “community of interest” as much as feasible in the current redistricting process.

936,written,,,Concern for Redistricting Plans,"Good evening, commissioners. Thank you for adhering to a democratic process which allows citizens to share our thoughts and concerns. My name is Cynthia Davis. I have called Hudsonville, Georgetown Township, Ottawa County home for nearly fifty years. There is a diversity of communities of interest in Hudsonville, Georgetown Township and Ottawa County. The Hudsonville Public School district covers approximately eighty square miles which includes zip codes for Hudsonville, Jenison, Allendale, Zeeland, Hamilton, Byron Center and Grandville. Hudsonville is called the Salad Bowl City because of the rich tradition of agriculture that it shares with all of Ottawa County, and yet manufacturing is fast making inroads in these geographical communities. The services of the Hudsonville Public Library are used by patrons from Jamestown Township, Blendon Township and Georgetown Township just as Hudsonville patrons might use those libraries. These communities have been friendly rivals for decades, yet they support and share in community activities and events. Georgetown Township was ranked by an MLive report as number thirty of the seventy-five largest cities and townships in Michigan. Hudsonville is the third largest city in Ottawa County. Ottawa County is the fastest growing county in Michigan. All of this means that the community of interest identified today for redistricting may not be the same community of interest in five years. My further concern is that the community of interest assigned to me may not represent me. We need to keep intact the diverse communities of interest to ensure that citizens are represented equally. Therefore, I would urge the commission to follow the Apol standards established by the Michigan Supreme Court and to keep Ottawa County intact at both the State and Federal levels rather than basing redistricting on communities of interest which might change or might not even exist in a few short years."
937,written,,"grand rapids city,grand rapids,kentwood,wyoming",Case for Kentwood and Grand Rapids,"Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today.  My name is Andrew Ysasi, and I live in Grand Rapids, MI, here in Kent County.  I was raised in Grand Rapids.    The City of Kentwood is our neighbor and part of the Grand Rapids metro area.  We are tightly intertwined, yet we are in separate districts despite having communities of interest.  Evidence of the connection and importance of Kentwood to the Grand Rapids area is the joint Wyoming/Kentwood Chamber of Commerce, yet both Wyoming and Kentwood are represented differently.  M-6, or the Paul B. Henry Freeway, opened in 2001.  M-6 is 19.7 miles long and connects the business and residential areas in the southern Grand Rapids metropolitan area.   Two districts separate the center, ironically, the communities of Wyoming and Kentwood.  Further, M-6 crosses 4 districts, all while under 20 miles.    I'm here today because the people in southwest Michigan, the wonderful people in Hartford, Michigan, likely have little to no connection to the City of Kentwood residents 75 miles away and nearly an hour and a half drive, yet they share the same district.   Therefore, I respectfully recommend the commission take a close look at the southern part of the Grand Rapids metropolitan area to ensure our communities of interest are acknowledged by the commission.  Thank you for your time.  "
938,written,,,Keep Townships Together,"Ladies and Gentlemen – Thank you for your service.  I appreciate you taking the time to listen to the public’s insights and concerns as you set about making decisions regarding redistricting lines.  Between the evaluation criteria of Balancing Populations, Geographic Contiguity and Compactness, Keeping Communities of Interest together, Boundary Preservation, and adhering to the Voting Rights Act, the tradeoffs you face in making your decisions appear overwhelming.    My name is Tom Nemcek and I moved to West Michigan in 1992.  I moved into my current home approximately 26 years ago and selected my community of interest in Cascade Township based on the same data and criteria that MOST people use to figure out where they would like to settle down – namely, safe streets and low crime rates, excellent school districts, affordable home prices with the opportunity for price appreciation, a robust and diverse business community with access to highways and airports, proximity to vibrant entertainment and dining venues, and prudent use and conservation of the abundant natural resources in this area.  You may have heard the expression “West Michigan Nice”.  This truly reflects on my community of interest which is a welcoming community for all people – regardless of race, color, or creed – who share traditional family and community values of respect and appreciation for the beautiful natural resources abundant in our communities.  Having spent more hours online than I care to admit using the DistrictR online software to draw and evaluate districts, I can tell you that the challenges you face are indeed daunting.  I will say that utilizing the 10-year-old Census Data in the software made some decisions somewhat of a stab in the dark without knowing what the current data looks like, so I hope you will have updated data to help you make your decisions.  May logic, wisdom, and common sense guide your decisions in making fair decisions in this effort.   As I mentioned, I live in Southeast Kent County in Cascade Township in State House District 86 which is currently an awkward u-shaped area in red shown on this map (hold up map) and includes ZIP Codes 49546 and 49341 and stretches from Cascade Township on the West all the way to the City of Ionia on the East and encompasses what I affectionately to refer to simply as “The Townships District”:  Ada Township Bowne Township Caledonia Township Cascade Township Easton Township Ionia Township and the City of Ionia  Grattan Township Lowell Township and the City of Lowell Orleans Township Otisco Township and the City of Belmont and Vergennes Township    If your desire and goal is to “square off” and simplify districts, it would make a LOT of sense to keep The Townships District communities together and utilize township lines to draw the district.     I am submitting two Proposals for House District 86 – both utilizing township lines.  Proposal 1 encompasses 12 adjoining townships with a population of 94,537 (2010 Census Data) and a Deviation from the target population of 5.21%.  Proposal 2 also encompasses 12 adjoining townships with a population of 89,911 (2010 Census Data) and a Deviation of just 0.07%      This would simplify and square up Michigan House District 86 utilizing the township lines while maintaining the similar communities of interest in “The Townships”.   I also reside in State Senate District 29.  If you review the geographic boundaries of West Michigan Senate Districts, you will notice that the vast majority of them generally follow County Lines – Senate District 30 is Ottawa County, Senate District 20 is Kalamazoo County, Senate District 26 is Allegan and Van Buren Counties (with a small cut out into Kent County), Senate District 19 is Barry, Calhoun, and Ionia Counties, and Senate District 34 is Muskegon, Oceana, and Newaygo Counties.    But NOT Senate District 29 which is a bizarrely gerrymandered geographic district that lumps the urban communities in the City of Grand Rapids and East Grand Rapids which are significantly distinct from the more pastoral and even rural communities of interest in “The Townships” as I previously mentioned.  I am also submitting 2 proposals for State Senate District 29.  Proposal 1 includes the City of Grand Rapids, City of East Grand Rapids, and portions of the City of Wyoming and City of Kentwood with a natural southern border of 44th Street.  The population for this proposal is 262,479 (2010 Census Data) with a Deviation of 0.92% from the target population.  Proposal 1 includes the City of Grand Rapids, City of East Grand Rapids, and the City of Wyoming.  This proposal has a population of 270,857 (2010 Census Data) and a Deviation of 4.14%.  Both of these proposals are compact and geographically contiguous with very similar urban style communities. "

OUCSD comprised of 22-block-clubs and is one of the oldest established block organizations in the city of Detroit.  SWD 48217 is a borderline community located on the most southern tip of the city bordered by Lincoln Park, Melvindale, Ecorse and River Rouge.  SWD 48217 is predominately African American which has a high-rate of homeownership.  We are connected to greater Detroit by  three Bascule Bridges and I-75 that runs North and South through the community.  SWD 48217 zip code has been split due to gerrymandering.  In SWD 48217 families living right across the street from each other has a different state representative and that is not right.  4821 7 District #6 has two state representatives and two state senators. We want SWD 48217 to be made whole as one zip code with one state senator and one state representative. "

In Marquette County, Rep. Sara Cambensy's district is partially split and shared with another representative. This makes no sense and perhaps you have already addressed this: she does not have Ishpeming and Powell Townships. If you have not considered this, please do so. Sara has told me it doesn't matter to her but from a county perspective, it's not only unfair to the constituents and less easy to coordinate county and township issues. Thank you. LD"

The district maps need to reflect reasonable looking shapes that are based on municipal, county, city, and township boundaries. Every resident of Michigan identifies with the municipality that they reside in. Their municipality is their community. The commission even encourages all commenters to provide the city/county that the commenters reside in or identify with. Drawing districts based on municipal boundaries promotes a fair-minded, neutral, and non-partisan redistricting plan. Let the voters chose their politicians, use municipal boundaries to draw the district lines."

Our representative adheres mainly to the Holland area and even then doesn’t reach out. We need to represent more than the white population as there is much more than that living in our area and north. The lines need to be redrawn and more defined to the reality of our location.  There is Ferrysburg, Spring Lake, Fruitport, Norton shores. Muskegon, North Muskegon, that are connected in population and needs. We hope for a fair redistricting for the future."

I have served families in the public school system for 17 years in some of our most diverse areas of Michigan and 12 years ago made my home in Rockford.  I’m also a Plainfield Township Precinct Captain in District Six. During my tenure I have witnessed a lack of equity and diversity across our county school districts, with many districts struggling financially because district lines were drawn up for monetary and political reasons.  I want to thank you for drawing up new and fair voting districts based on the 7 criteria you have listed rather than boundaries drawn for political gain. During the task of redistricting, it’s imperative that you keep in mind that the districts must reflect the state's diverse population and communities of interest. Populations that share cultural or historical characteristics must have an opportunity to be represented fairly across West Michigan.  It has been clear to me, as a mother and educator in our county, that there is a lack of diversity in representation across districts.  We need to give all voters a voice. For hundreds of years, our country has been known worldwide as a melting pot of culture and heritage, this was something many of us were proud of.  The term melting pot comes from the idea that all of the cultural differences meld together, as if they were metals being melted down to become a stronger alloy.  We must show that we value all of our communities of interest and allow all of these communities an opportunity for fair representation.    Again, thank you so much for your time and effort in this momentous task. I appreciate the work you’re doing to ensure that all residents are represented in your work.

949,written,,"hartland township,communties of interest,shifting population and need,need for balanced fair maps","Concept of ""community of interest""","I am commenting as a ten-year resident of Hartland Township located in the northwest quadrant of Livingston County.    Thirty years ago, Hartland was a quiet, rural/agricultural community with strong ties to its historic nineteenth century roots and the two-lane road connecting Hartland with Howell and the county seat.  (I am personally familiar with this because a family member relocated in the early 90s and raised three kids to adulthood here.)  Deep historic roots remain but much has changed, driven by the expansion of US-23 and highway M-59 that intersect the former rural region, changing the landscape and focus from bucolic farms to a busy crossroads.  This area is evolving different characteristics as both growth and development continue.     The way Hartland and neighboring townships are developing is creating shifting patterns not only of traffic flow but also of people drawn and moving into and/or working in the area.   The entire M-59 corridor is rapidly changing.  New planned development in Hartland Township will bring many hundreds of new residents and attendant services.  Looking at planned mixed housing and commercial development along M-59 near Fenton and Pleasant Valley roads, it seems apparent that this area will draw more varied lifestyles, needs, and interests.  Hartland's area (and adjacent townships) increasingly have as much in common with Highland and Commerce in neighboring Oakland County to the east, as the Livingston County seat in Howell, to the west.    “Community of Interest” is a tricky concept.    All to say, I hope that redistricting deliberations and mapping decisions are not tied to county jurisdictions and instead focus on achieving more balanced and fair and far less gerrymandered maps.    I look forward to the “first pass” of new maps and hope that everyone will be a bit unhappy.  The state, counties, and regions are shifting, and the citizens of Michigan spoke clearly when they said, “Yes, we need greater opportunities for our voices to be heard and counted. Ultimately, the task is to achieve greater balance and more fair legislative representation.    Thank you all, very much, for your painstaking work on behalf of voters across this state.  "

Thank you for reading my testimony.  I supported Proposition 2.  I am asking you to start fresh with our redistricting maps so we can support fair and equitable elections.  I don't want to see old gerrymandering maps that unfairly favor or disfavor incubant candidates.  Grand Rapids is changing and becoming a more diverse city.  Old ways of mapping...doing the same thing over only inhibits fairness and equity.  We need a modern day honest assessment.

Grand Rapids can be better with balanced district maps where everyone is equally represented.  Thank yiu.
952,written,,,Gerrymandering,"I live in Kentwood and my congressional vote essentially doesn't count because my district (congressional district 2) is heavily gerrymandered. This district is mostly based in Holland and the surrounding area, which is heavily Republican, but has a little leg that loops over to include the suburbs to the south of Grand Rapids which tend to be more Democrat. I still vote in every election, but I feel that my vote does not count and that I do not have proper representation in Congress.  One way to begin redistricting in a fair manner  would be to use a hexagonal system,  laying a grid of hexagons over the state to draw congressional districts and adjusting the size of them to contain the same number of people based on population density. Thus, highly populated areas would have more and smaller hexagons and less densely populated areas would have larger hexagons, though some may be slightly misshapen due to geographical features. This may not be a foolproof system without bugs, but it is a way to start. I look forward to a time where I really feel that my voice is heard and not drowned out by extreme partisan gerrymandering. I hope every state is able to redraw their maps to be more fair as well."

I was born and raised in a region of suburban Detroit we call ""Downriver."" My grandparents moved to southwest Detroit from Canada and Ohio and then moved to the first circle of suburbs within Downriver. As has been the case with families ever since, subsequent generations in my family moved simply to the next Downriver community over: in my lifetime, I've lived in seven of our 16 communities, and have family and friends who live in every other community. With the launch of this non-partisan redistricting  process, I see a chance to provide representation to our ""Community of Interest"" that reflects this generational connection between and among our cities and townships - including that portion of Southwest Detroit that many of our families claim as the roots of their heritage. I've obviously written extensively about the unique nature of our community, its people, politics and promises for the future. Should the Commission protect this unique nature, I believe those promises can be fulfilled by providing representation that unifies our needs and dreams.

954,written,,,Southwest Michigan Lakeshore COI,"Testimony before the Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission Muskegon, Michigan - June 29, 2021  Good Evening, my name is Rick Catherman, a resident of South Haven. I want to thank the Commission for your work and for the opportunity to speak this evening.  I am here to ask you to consider information that will allow citizens sharing common interests, and concerns to be represented in Lansing and Washington D.C. by people that best understand and live with these same issues on a regular basis. My community, and those facing similar challenges, are currently being represented by individuals that aren’t able to completely understand the factors impacting the lives of our residents.  The south west coast of Michigan, including South Haven, St. Joseph, and as far south as New Buffalo confront similar challenges facing all Michigan citizens. However the factors contributing to our issues are unique to the lakeshore area, and the citizens of our communities will be best represented by someone that lives and works in our area. Lakeshore erosion, beach preservation, local control of short term rentals, developing affordable housing allowing workers to live in the same community where they work, reviving the tourism economy, creating jobs that attract, maintain and provide wages for both seasonal and year-round workers, are but a few of the issues requiring knowledgeable representation for reasonable and appropriate solutions. These aren’t issues that more inland communities even in the same county have to contend with, and they, much like us, should be represented by someone familiar with their issues.   Minority representation is another important factor. Current Southwest Michigan electoral maps divide communities of color. A map that will bring together the larger African American communities of South Haven, Benton Harbor and Covert, will allow all citizens to realize more fair and equitable representation leading to policies benefiting the greater community. Providing more diverse representation at all levels of government is important. Electoral maps that bring communities of color together, rather than divide those communities, should be a priority.  When drawing the new electoral maps please consider the southwest lakeshore area as a community of interest. A map that brings together our communities will provide more equitable and inclusive representation and allow us to more responsibly preserve our lakeshore communities so that they can be accessed by people across Michigan and from neighboring states.

I feel that it is important for the Commission to make every effort to endure that the districts are fair and representative of the citizens of our state.  Maps should avoid packing and cracking and other gerrymandering techniques used by political parties.  People deserve to have their vote count, their voices heard at the polls and to have responsive elected officials.  Gerrymandering nullifies the voices of voters and allows elected officials to do what their party tells them to do rather than work in the best interest of the voters.  "
957,written,,,Redistricting Plan for Michigan,"I am  writing to voice my concerns for the redistricting of Michigan.  Michigan's new districts need to be drawn along the existing boundary lines of cities, townships and counties as much as possible.  The people residing in these communities have already formed common interests and should be able to vote for their representation as the group they already are. Any other type of districting  would simple be another form of gerrymandering.  Districts such as the ones which combine two population areas by a small strip of land should not be allowed.  Also following the existing lines  will save money printing ballots and cause less confusion as to where to vote."

I believe this was a great move. I want to address the importance of keeping both Allegan and Van Buren Counties in the same legislative district. I believe both of these counties form a “community of interest” due to several key factors. First, both counties are very rural and both have a very heavy focus on agriculture. For example, my family is very involved in agriculture in Van Buren County and some of our suppliers are based in Allegan County. Secondly, M-40 fully spans both counties which allows many businesses to operate along the highway attracting people to invest and consume goods in both counties. Thirdly, both counties have very similar costs of living. I believe these all to be very important factors for the commission to consider when drawing up our legislative districts. I know my beliefs are shared by many others. This is due to my time and effort to ask others who live and conduct business in both counties. I appreciate your time and service. "

My community of interest is Lenawee County which is on the Ohio border between Hillsdale and Monroe Counties.  Lenawee County has just under 100,000 residents.  My desire is to keep Lenawee County whole to maintain the cohesiveness within our non-profit community. Our community, Lenawee County, best understands the basic needs and growth of our citizens and therefore, should remain whole. Lenawee County has amazing community support for well over 100 non-profit organizations. These organizations include, but are not limited to: Food Pantries, Animal Rescue Services, Pregnancy Care Centers, Homeless Shelters, Child Advocacy Centers, Veterans Groups, Rehabilitation Services, the Arts, Domestic Violence Centers, Youth Organizations, Housing Help and People with Disabilities.  Every single one of these non-profit organizations is essential to our community which is Lenawee County.  We all work together by volunteering and donating to keep these organizations running for the citizens who need them to survive.  It is imperative that Lenawee County remain intact to keep our non-profit community thriving.  We do not want to encounter conflicting interests competing for basic needs and services for the community if we were to be divided.  In addition, I believe that every non-densely populated county in Michigan should remain whole whenever possible.  Most counties have a uniqueness that defines the essence of COMMUNITY.  Thank you  "
962,written,,,Every County is a Community of Interest,"Dear Commissioners:  Thank you for receiving public input.   In drawing election maps, I suggest that the splitting of all governmental boundaries be kept to a minimum. Counties, cities, and townships are communities of interest.     In Isabella County, where I reside, the population is bound together culturally and economically. We all enjoy the same services: county and city parks, public schools, police, animal control, emergency services, and senior services.  When the city of Mt. Pleasant has major events, such as Citizen of the Year, the venue rotates among property in the City, the Saginaw Chippewa Soaring Eagle Casino, and property in a township.  County residents shop, dine, and enjoy recreation in the same space. Isabella County, like other counties, is a cultural and economic unit.    Isabella County is not large enough for a single Michigan House District.  If you add population to Isabella County (population 70,000) to build a House District, please do not divide the city of Alma (population 9,000) or Midland County (population 80,000) to do it.  Similarly, when you draw boundaries for the Michigan Senate and U.S. Congress, it seems reasonable to keep intact Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas.   Sincerely,   Laura Lund, DDS Mt.

It is a part of Cass County, which is two counties East of Lake Michigan. The area where I live includes the Village of Edwardsburg, a number of lake communities and rural areas.  My Michigan “community of interest” includes my lake community in Ontwa Township. Places I go in Michigan for recreation and entertainment are in Cass County and heading west through Berrien County, all the way to Lake Michigan. I go to government offices in Niles, Dowagiac and St. Joseph/Benton Harbor. Like many people in this area, my community also includes Indiana cities just across the Michigan southern state border (location of friends, my former workplace, shopping, medical and dental providers, bank and entertainment).  To validate that my experience is similar to others in my area, I created a questionnaire about locations where Ontwa Township residents go for various activities and services. These included work, school, children’s school, worship, groceries, other supplies, government services, doctor or dentist, recreation, entertainment, social clubs, restaurants, and financial business. Ten people, including me, who all reside in Ontwa Township, completed the questionnaire.  The respondents could list up to three locations for each item (or respond “not applicable” or choose not to respond). There were a total of 157 location responses. Since we live very near the Indiana border, larger cities in Indiana that are just south of us were listed for many of our activities (Elkhart, Granger, Mishawaka and South Bend). After excluding all out-of-state locations (total of 81 responses), there were 76 responses that were Michigan locations (these included 15 unique locations).  The most frequently listed Michigan locations were Niles (20), Edwardsburg (15), and Ontwa Township (9). Next were Cassopolis (6), New Buffalo (5), St. Joseph (4), Dowagiac (4) and Cass County (3). There were a variety of other locations in Berrien County listed (7 total) and some farther away locations (3 responses).  When broken down by the most frequently listed Michigan counties, locations in Cass County were listed a total of 37 times and Berrien County 36 times.  From this survey, I conclude that our community of interest in Ontwa Township includes Cassopolis and Dowagiac in Cass County, and extends south to the Indiana state line. It also includes Berrien County to our west, including Niles, extending west to the Lake Michigan shoreline and north to St. Joseph/Benton Harbor.

I believe that this can end one form of political corruption that has existed in our country since 1813.   Districts drawn by your commission will be more objective, more fair.  And on a level playing field, I believe that political parties  will have to win votes by making the best case to an electorate that has not been cracked, stacked, packed or whacked.  And that makes government better.     So thank you for the very serious work that you are doing on behalf of the citizens of Michigan. "

I live in the city of Midland in Midland County. Thank you for serving on the Commission.  I want to tell you about an issue that is important to me.  It is rural broadband.  I believe it is a community of interest for you to consider when updating the district maps.  Here in Midland County we still have spots driving west down M-20 for example, where service just completely disappears or you go north and are in a complete dead zone.  This issue connects Midland with our rural communities to the west and north who also have limited access.  We all know how important it is to have internet access in our global economy.  I can give you a multitude of examples of why internet access is so important. Our businesses need it to be able to compete. Our farmers utilize the internet to manage their crops. Our students need the internet to further their education. Our seniors benefit greatly from tele-medicine to get care.  However, unlike the metropolitan areas of this state and bigger cities of Grand Rapids, Lansing, Saginaw and Flint, our residents do not have the same access.  I believe Midland County should be put together with the other rural counties in mid and northern Michigan.  Working together our voices will not be lost to the densely populated areas that don’t have the same needs.  I’d ask that you keep Midland County whole and include it in a district with our rural neighboring counties who not only understand our need for rural broadband but are already working together with us to address this issue. Thank you. "
967,written,,,Principles for drawing maps,"Hello, Commissioners,  I want to argue for four principles in drawing districts.  The first is that no self-interested entity, including the Michigan Legislature, or either major party, should have unchecked power to draw the lines. Just like prosecutors have judges and juries to keep them from overzealous prosecutions, politicians should be barred from overzealous  drawing of legislative districts. If politicians draw the maps themselves, they will do it with political advantage in mind and not the needs of the public. It's inevitable. Therefore  a neutral third party should draw the maps. That's why the MCRC exists and that's why I'm  grateful for your service. I want to encourage you to remain neutral and dispassionate.  Second, start drawing maps with a clean slate. The existing maps are based on the political thumb wrestling that the MCRC was created to avoid. Forget them, at least at the start.  Third, all districts should have populations as nearly equal as practicable.  I believe that is already a legal requirement so I won't say more.  Fourth, I want to encourage you to draw maps in such a way that the statewide vote for each party is translated as nearly as possible to the proportionate number of seats in the respective legislative body. This is potentially difficult. Some groups that vote together are more concentrated geographically and some are more dispersed. If the tightest possible districts are drawn, it's  likely that the concentrated districts will have a high percentage of wasted votes. That is, these districts will be ""packed"" and more votes will be translated into fewer seats. Districts should be drawn in a way that wastes the fewest votes either by packing or by cracking. As I’m sure you already know, there are methods to estimate, and thus minimize, wasted votes. The “efficiency gap” metric is one such method. The districts might be a little more awkward that way but it will more accurately translate the will of the public into power in the legislative bodies.  Thank you for your attention. Your work is difficult but important. Good luck and drink lots of water. "
968,written,,,Comments on past and VNP criteria ,"Bruce A. Timmons  2147 Tamarack Dr Okemos MI 48864 June 30, 2021  Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission. P.O. Box 30318,  Lansing MI 48909.  Members of the MICRC:  I am not an expert on redistricting but have followed this issue since 1963-64 when I wrote an undergraduate thesis on Legislative Redistricting in Michigan which began as a defense of the 80-20 formula in the newly adopted Michigan Constitution of 1963 and concluded with an endorsement of one-person, one-vote. I was among the literal handful of public attendees at meetings of the Legislative Apportionment Commission. During a 45-year career in various legal and policy positions with the Michigan Legislature (1967-20212), I intersected in some way with that issue every ten years, except after the 2010 census.    With Regard to Congressional Redistricting  The first task of the Commission will be to determine if Michigan can still have two majority-minority (Black) districts in keeping with the dictates of the federal voting rights act – and if so, and presuming that can be done, how those two districts will be drawn. The racial composition of Detroit and surrounding territory will have to be known. (If 2 Black districts are not possible, the Commission’s task becomes much simpler as Detroit will need approximately another 100,000 residents to from one majority-minority district.)   When the voting rights act first applied, Detroit had enough population to form two majority-minority districts predominantly of Detroit residents. I will begin with 1970 after the first census under the Voting Rights Act and up to the current districts as the population of each district continues to grow in size of population.    In 1970 Michigan had a population of 8,875,083. Each of 19 districts had a population of 467,540 to 467.542. Detroit’s population was 1,514,063. Two full congressional districts were in Detroit (1st/Conyers and 13th/Diggs/Crockett) and substantially a third (14th/Nedzi/Hertel) with portions of Macomb Co. The 16th/Dingell) had a small piece of Detroit.  In 1980 Michigan had a population of 9,255,553. Each of 18 districts would have had a population of 514,197-514,198. Detroit’s population was 1,203,368. Two full congressional districts were in Detroit (1st /Conyers) and 13th /Crockett/Collins). A portion of Detroit was included with a larger portion of Macomb Co in the 14th /Hertel).   In 1990 Michigan had a population of 9,310,462. Each of 16 districts had an average population of 581,904. With Detroit having a population of 1,027,974, two whole districts would not fit inside the city. The 14th (Conyers), with a population of 580,956 included smaller communities to the east of Detroit, Highland Park, and a few blocks of Dearborn Hts. The 15th (Collins/Kilpatrick), also with a population of 580,956, included 3 of the Pointes, Hamtramck, Ecorse, and River Rouge.   But in 2000, Michigan had a population of 9,938,444 and Detroit’s population had fallen to 951,270, as it continued to lose further political clout. Each of 15 districts had 662,562-662,563 residents. See MCL 3.54(e)(i): All but one district had 662,563 people and the exception (10th district) had 662,562. The city was only ‘entitled’ to about 1-1/2 districts, so the 13th and 14th extended beyond Detroit’s borders to comply with the voting rights act and to include the additional population needed. The 13th (Kilpatrick/Clarke) added all of the Grosse Pointes, Harper Woods, River Rouge, Wyandotte, and Lincoln Park. The 14th (Conyers) added Hamtramck, Highland Park, much of Dearborn, and down-river communities of Gibraltar, Grosse Ile, Melvindale, Riverview, Southgate, and Trenton. Both districts were fully inside Wayne County.    In 2010 Michigan had a population of 9,877,597. Each of 14 districts had 705,542-705,543 inhabitants. Detroit’s population was 713,777 (reflecting a loss of 25% in a decade), barely qualifying for a single district, but for the voting rights act that required the city to be split between the 13th and 14th districts. The 13th (Conyers/Tlaib) extended farther west to include more communities such as Redford Twp, Garden City, Inkster, Romulus, Wayne, and Westland.  The 14th (Peters/Lawrence) still included all of the Grosse Pointes, the enclosed enclaves of Highland Park and Hamtramck, then crossed 8-Mile Road for the first time and extended into Oakland County like a snake up into Oakland County through Oak Park, Southfield, Farmington Hills, and West Bloomfield to reach and include Pontiac. The picture of this district was a poster-child that advocates circulating the VNP petitions were using to show how gerrymandered Michigan’s redistricting  plans were – but its shape was not due to gerrymandering but rather where Blacks lived to fulfill the Voting Rights Act requirement of two majority-minority districts.   Note that a majority-minority district only ensures the opportunity to elect a Black candidate. It does not guarantee election of a Black Representative, as the 2012 to 2020 elections prove.    In 2020 Michigan has a population of 9,966,555 but only 13 districts. The average district must now have 775,726 or 775.727 residents – 40% more people than the 1970 district average.     With the loss of a congressional district under the 2020 census, your task will be much harder because the total population of Detroit (estimated to be about 680,000) does not have enough people to form one district.   Your problem is not the criteria but where people choose to live.  Without having access to necessary demographic data that the Commission will eventually have, I would surmise that in order to produce two majority-minority (Back) districts it is unlikely that demographics west and southwest of Detroit will provide a sufficient number of Black residents to achieve that objective. Rather, one (call it, “south Detroit”) district may have to include the bulk of Detroit in order to form a Black district. The second (call it, “north Detroit”) district will need to include a lesser share of Detroit residents and again wind its way up through Oak Park, Southfield, Farmington, and West Bloomfield to include Pontiac – just as the present 14th does. For 2022, that district may need to extend even farther north of Pontiac to include Flint – resulting in a district shape not unlike the form of the current 14th that spurred the VNP petition drive.  In fact, it is possible that the “north Detroit” district will have a more contorted shape than the current 14th in order to comply with the federal Voting Rights Act.       With Regard to Criteria for State House and Senate Districts:  	While the so-called criteria set by the Michigan Supreme Court for the plans it adopted and ordered into effect for the 1980’s and 1990’s allowed a departure of plus or minus 8.2%, when the Legislature adopted redistricting criteria in 1996 for state senate and house districts, it lowered the acceptable deviation from the absolute average to plus or minus 5%. See Sec. 1(d), 1996 PA 463, MCL 4.261: 	(d) Senate and house of representatives districts shall have a population not exceeding 105% and not less than 95% of the ideal district size for the senate or the house of representatives unless and until the United States supreme court establishes a different range of allowable population divergence for state legislative districts. 	That standard applied to the plans the Legislature enacted in 2001 for state senate and house districts from which legislators were elected in 2002 through 2010. See also MCL 4.2005(a) as part of the bill/act enacting state senate and house redistricting plans in 2001.  (Despite widespread claims that the districts favored Republicans, it is incontrovertible that Democrats won a majority of House seats in 2006 and 2008 to control the House during both the 2007-08 and 2009-10 Sessions of the Legislature.)   	I presume that same standard applied to the plans enacted by the Legislature in 2011.  	It is a curious omission from the VNP criteria that there is no limit on the acceptable deviation from the population average for either Senate or House, other than an oblique reference to compliance with the US Constitution and federal voting rights act. I presume the Commission plans will not deviate more than plus or minus 5% for senate or house districts – just as the Legislature’s standard under MCL 4.261.  I would certainly urge great caution to any consideration of a wider deviation that would certainly be challenged in court and would subject the commission’s final plans to public and editorial criticism for violating the one-vote, one-person principle.  	Creating districts using governmental boundary lines (county, township, and city) to the maximum extent possible – as statutory criteria required for 2001 and 2011 redistricting for congressional, state senate, and state house seats – or respecting governmental boundary lines under the VNP criteria, Art IV, Sec.6, subsection 13(f) – is an objective criterion and often may provide an identity akin to a “community of interest”. Whether it is neutral or biased is a matter of opinion. 	The use of “communities of interest” is subjective – in the proverbial “eye of the beholder” – that provides no historical context in Michigan and, to the extent used as the basis for districting in 2021, will open the MICRC to criticism no matter how the final districts “look” or where those lines are drawn to include or exclude voters.  Please use this subjective criterion carefully – public acceptance of the final plans may depend upon how this criterion is used.   Thank you for giving these comments your consideration.  Respectfully,   Bruce A. Timmons  Bjctimmons@comcast.net  (517) 349-2356"
969,written,,,G. Marnon's community,"Dear MICRC members,  I am writing to let you know about my community.  I have lived in Shiawassee County for nearly 24 years, and all that time, it has remained whole in the State House and Senate districts as well as the Congressional district. Shiawassee county is a community of interest.  The people in the county are all small town, rural, agricultural, type people.  While we live near the ""large"" cities of Flint and Lansing, the people and what matters to us couldn't be more different than the people in the ""city"", so I strongly encourage you to take that into consideration when drawing the new district lines.  In fact, the 85th House district is perfect as it is since most everyone in the district shares similar interests, values, and desires for their lives. Having a representative who's district is made up of people with similar ideas of what is important makes him more responsive since he isn't dividing his attention between groups with very divergent needs.  As a county, we share a love of the county fair.  Unlike other counties, the Shiawassee County fair draws participants from the whole county and is really a countywide affair rather than a festival or carnival as it is in many other counties. The county has a common busing system, the SATA bus. The regional educational school district or RESD coordinates all the schools in the county, and in fact, when I was a substitute teacher for the county, there was a countywide substitute teacher system called the BUBBA system. The Curwood festival draws people from the whole county as does the annual 4th of July festivities in McCurdy Park.  After living just outside of Owosso for 17 years, we moved to Perry in the southern part of the county, and I am now geographically closer to Haslett than to Owosso. But trust me when I tell you the people in Haslett are very different than the people in Perry or any part of Shiawassee county for that matter. Haslett, Okemos and East Lansing are more much more suburban rather than small town rural, something to keep in mind should you need to expand the current district to get to the proper population.   Districts should be kept as compact as possible so that everyone has access to his/her representative and senator.  Having the ability to attend townhall meetings with our elected officials is important as is having a district that is compact enough that the elected representatives can participate in their whole district. So I believe districts should remain as compact as possible and should try to preserve towns and cities as whole rather than breaking them up.  If a town has an issued, it is a lot easier to talk to one representative than it is to talk to two or three if that town is divided.  So, in order to preserve representative government, allow people access to their representatives, and preserve a community of interest, Shiawassee county should remain intact, and the cities and townships should remain whole.  Thank you."
970,written,,,Why competitive elections are vital,"I am Janet Wright, an older person, married and living in a condominium in Pittsfield Township. Condo living suits us very well in many respects and we are very happy living where we are, but we are unable to install solar panels, though we would like to do so. Many of my friends have a similar issue.   We are well aware that in order to slow climate change before it becomes an irreversible problem, we need to electrify our appliances and vehicles. The lack of clean, renewable energy provided by our power company currently leaves no alternative to generating our own electricity for those of us who are deeply concerned about our future and that of our children and grandchildren.  Our inability to install personal solar panels on our home would not matter if we could buy into a community solar project. I’m sure many such projects would spring up in this area and in many other areas if they were allowed by State law, but they are not.  I believe that if the Michigan House and Senate districts were not gerrymandered, there would be more genuine competition for seats and those running for office would be more likely to listen to what their constituents want. Many people both liberal and conservative would like the ability to have their own solar power but currently there are major limitations on this.  Thank you for considering this very important issue and good luck to you in your difficult job.      "

A bipartisan commission absolutely must create a system that reflects the will of the majority of the voters, not subvert that will to pander to left or right wing extremists. Our voters are rightfully cynical and that weakens our democracy of majority rule.  Our democracy appears weak to other countries because nobody values compromise.  Only the most extreme, entrenched ideologies are getting elected which polarizes us further and inhibits common sense legislation.  Prove China and Russia wrong.

I want our district to remain compact and physically in tact.  Historically Shiawassee County has been kept whole.  Our county meets the criteria of competitiveness as well as partisan fairness. Votes result in winning candidates from both parties. The district at the present shares cultural, historical and economic interests.  Dividing the county population would be detrimental in every aspect. Please keep Shiawassee County mainly as its own Michigan House District (85) and keep the county whole when creating Michigan Senate District (24) and US Congressional District (4th).

978,written,,,To Form a More Perfect Union,"Fred Overeem,  Resident of Rockford for 58 years. Of Michigan , much Longer  I would like to thank the members of the Apportionment Commission for their willingness to spend the time and endure the frustration that it takes to make a significant improvement in the manner in which democracy is carried out in our state.  During the campaign I played a minor role by hosting  informational meetings and talking with voters in person and online.   I consider partisan gerrymandering an insidious form of corrupting our democracy. From the time of Elbridge Gerry to the present, this corrupting practice has been used to subvert elections, to frustrate the will of the people.  In my opinion the current district maps are an example of an obvious partisan gerrymander.  With little imagination, one can see bow tie, polliwog and earthworm shaped districts. Panhandles and corridors are not uncommon.  In some cases voters have been chosen individually and moved from district to district to achieve the desired partisan results. Modern technology has brought the gerrymander to new levels of sophistication. Seemingly all done to circumvent the will of the voters. Therefore, the current district lines should be completely disregarded.   I reside in the city of Rockford. It is a century old historic city on the outskirts of Grand Rapids.  Our city council districts have relatively compactly drawn borders and are reasonably competitive. The county commission and state legislative districts are another matter. Long thin Legislative districts wandering the length of the county and a district twisting erratically through the city of Grand Rapids choosing precincts like a predictor serpent searching for prey are, to me, evidence of both cracking and packing.   The seven criteria submitted by the Michigan Independent Redistricting Committee are consistent with principals put forth by those expert in and advocating for just democratic government. I urge the redistricting commission to follow those guidelines when they draw our new, more democratic districts. Remember, we Americans and Michiganians claim the principals of a democracy. In a democracy or democratic republic, the majority does rule.   The ruling group however must not oppress theminority and it must not interfere with the right of a minority to become a majority. "

I'm writing to ask you to consider keeping Washtenaw County in its entirely in a single district. I don't know if this is true of other counties, but Washtenaw has a real identity -- and, for funding purposes, forms a strong community of interest -- as a county. As we advocate at the state and federal levels for various policies, it's natural and coherent to argue about the county's needs, as a whole. Yet, as an eastern Washtenaw County resident, I share no representatives with neighbors in the western part of the county, with whom I feel quite a kinship and share a set of interests. I hope this is one of the disconnects we can remedy in this redistricting process.  Thanks for your consideration.  With all best wishes, Theresa Reid"
980,written,,,Redistricting Committee,"Hi, and thank you for your involvement in our state. I would just like to express my concern about redistricting for our community. I live on the west side of the state and see all in has to offer. In contemplating about redistricting, I would hope to be involved in communities that have the same similarities as our.  I understand diversity in views and opinions, but as a community we  need to have similar values, as we work and live together.  All the counties on the shoreline have similar backgrounds, population, and views. There are towns with greater wealth and resources and other communities that are smaller but still share those same resources. In redistricting, I would greatly appreciate if those lines were drawn where those communities are similar, such as all the counties on the coast line.  We know and appreciate our coastal communities and the impact of tourism that help grow our state. We would appreciate fair representation of all of the these shoreline communities, which may not have equal representation of  larger, populated counties.  I don't want to take more of your time and I appreciate the time and commitment you have already given me and to making our state a better place to live with equal representation to each section of division."
981,written,,,Don't divide up Greater Lansing ,"Dear Michigan Independent Citizen's Redistricting Commission, I write to support the idea of a non-partisan commission drawing a new map of congressional districts for the State of Michigan in such a way that does not divide the greater Lansing area into smaller voting districts.  Until my retirement, I was a resident of East Lansing and the Senior pastor of  a church in Lansing for seventeen years (2002-2019). Members of my working class congregation lived in Lansing, East Lansing, Okemos, Holt and Grand Ledge. I became very familiar with their lived experience through the many home visits that I made. I also had many personal contacts with people who knocked on our church doors seeking aid.   I loved the city and its vibrant “can do” people. But what was always alarming to me to me was the level of distress felt within their extended families. You do not have to go very far in anyone’s family tree to find people who are really struggling. Nearly everyone I met had a child or grandchild, niece, nephew or cousin who faced economic challenges and personal setbacks because of the economic condition of our shared city.  As I drove through town on these pastoral visits, I can’t tell how how often I saw “foreclosure” signs on rows of houses in poorer neighbors, especially in the area near St. Lawrence hospital, following the Financial Meltdown of 2008. I also met many employees who worked at the Oldsmobile Assembly plant before it closed, and who then received notices that their pensions were going to be reduced. The resultant financial strain added an emotional distress to their lives that frequently entered our conversations. These problems only grew over the subsequent years.  I was also frequently alarmed at the level of social distress felt by the young people in these families, as their teens and twenty year olds struggled with school, with futile efforts to find work that paid a living wage, and with debts that accumulated when they faced high medical bills. It seems to me that voters in Greater Lansing  face common challenges, and therefore need elective representatives who are familiar with their needs and aspirations.   And yet because of the way Michigan’s congressional map has been drawn in recent decades, the cities of Lansing and East Lansing were segmented and placed piece-meal into three districts with representatives whose minds were on constituents from elsewhere. For instance. Representative Mike Bishop did not maintain a local office in Lansing and visited town only once in his last term to meet constituents, and ran an office staff that was impatient and uninterested when Lansing and East Lansing constituents tried to contact him in Brighton by phone to voice their concerns.   Clearly, Greater Lansing was dismembered so that the concerns of its people would become a minority opinion in the mainly rural and suburban Detroit districts that they were placed in. Lansing voices were drowned out and ignored by this gerrymandered arrangement.  The unique urban challenges that residents of the Greater Lansing area face deserve a chance to be heard as one political voice. Please redistrict our state in a way that allows Lansing to receive undivided attention.   Sincerely, Rev. Dr. Richard H. Boyd 560 Little Lake Dr. Unit #13 Ann Arbor, Michigan 48103"
982,written,,,Fair Districts are Municipal Boundaries,"Fair voting districts should not look like gerrymandered octopuses that are drawn based on political beliefs, partisan politics, race, ethnicity, religion, or other suspect classes.  Fair districts lines should be based on traditional community boundaries with reasonable shapes, such as county, city, and township boundaries. Drawing districts based on municipal boundaries promotes a fair-minded, neutral, and non-partisan districting plan. Let the voters chose their politicians, use municipal boundaries to draw the district lines."
983,written,,,City of Monroe: urban concerns/interests,"As a lifelong resident of Monroe County I’ve primarily lived in the City of Monroe most of my 63 years, although my earliest memories date back to a home in the lakeshore community of Woodland Beach.  Currently retired from a career in public health nursing, my passion for promoting healthy lifestyles and safe communities persists.  My community of interest are the many parks, trails and outdoor recreational opportunities in the City of Monroe and at Sterling State Park, providing means for entertainment, physical and mental well-being, and strengthening communities within our neighborhoods. With many parks situated along the River Raisin and Lake Erie shoreline, addressing environmental pollution in our waterways and air is of highest concern.   Another serious health threat beleaguering our community is the ongoing opioid crisis and far too many drug-induced fatalities each year. Additionally, while overall crime rates have reportedly decreased, violent crimes are on the rise. Situated along the I-75 corridor between Toledo and Detroit, Monroe now faces similar challenges as these two urban metropolises.  The City of Monroe and surrounding townships’ priorities in infrastructure needs and community concerns differ than our neighboring rural-agricultural communities, nor are we a “border community” like our neighbors to the south. Our current health, safety, economic and environmental challenges are very much like other small urban communities, and opportunities for economic growth are more inline with the lakeshore and Downriver communities to our north.   In essence, when drawing new district lines for State House, please consider keeping the City of Monroe and the adjacent Townships of Monroe, Frenchtown and Berlin together, possibly adding Ash, LaSalle, and Rasinvillle as needed. For State Senate and US House, please consider adding areas north in Wayne County with similar interests and needs, especially lakeshore communities and areas along I-75 and US-24.  Thank you for your time, consideration and dedication in drawing fair and transparent district lines. "
984,written,,,Competitive elections for Leelanau count,"My ideal as a Michigan voter would be a district that was competitive, in the sense that there would be a good chance that the most qualified candidate would win, rather than one in which the winner is largely pre-determined by party affiliation. Personally, I am willing to vote for the best qualified candidate from either party. I would like to feel that my choice and others who vote on the basis of qualifications would make a difference. I have the distinct impression that is not the case now for our district. With the lines as they are, the advantages of the two major parties are far from balanced. It seems to me that redrawing the lines to include some other areas (e.g. parts of Traverse City and its suburbs) would better balance the choices available to Leelanau County voters."

986,written,,,Inclusion of Hamlin Township,Please include Hamlin Township in with Ludington when redistricting. 
987,written,,,Keep Fire Districts together ,"June 8, 2021 Michigan Redistricting Commission Novi, Michigan  As a resident of Cohoctah Township, Livingston County, Michigan I am writing to indicate two communities of interest under the newly enacted redistricting requirements.  First, I would like to thank you for considering my communities of interest. As I see it, on the federal congressional district. Michigan will have 13 Congressional seats. With the Michigan population increasing, the 13 congressional districts will become bigger. I see two easy seats, the city of Detroit and a few surrounding cities, and the northern part of Michigan. The remaining 11 congressional seats will be where your work is difficult. Other requirements that you must follow will add to this difficulty.  First, I would urge you to follow municipal jurisdictional lines to create fair districts. Keep cities intact. Keep township boundary lines intact. Do not split townships into several different districts. It is imperative that these jurisdictional lines be fully recognized by the Commission. This becomes critical when drawing State Representative and State Senate districts. Keeping these municipality and township lines intact will comply with your mandate as defined in the Michigan Constitution, Article IV, Section 6 (13)(f). “Communities of interest” have a higher priority than counties, city, and township boundaries. Testimony as to “communities of interest” shows that the vast majority of comments on “communities of interest” is to respect county, city, and township boundaries. By doing this, the people have elevated this provision to a higher priority in line with “communities of interest.” This brings me to my first community of interest. I reside in Cohoctah Township, Livingston County. To the north is Shiawassee County, Burns Township. Cohoctah Township has no connection with Shiawassee County. Rather, we consider ourselves a part of the overall community of Livingston County. Our elected representatives attend meetings involving their supervisors, clerks, and treasurers with other elected representatives in the County. Our representation within the Michigan Township Association is as a part of Livingston County. Keep our township in Livingston County.  I have heard comments in past commission hearings that Livingston County should be divided along the Grand River corridor. Please do not do this. Your mandate is to keep “communities of interest” intact. To divide Livingston County in half is to create chaos and division. You have the opportunity to create fair districts that are reasonably compact. Keep to jurisdictional boundaries.  My second community of interest involves our local fire department. Cohoctah Township is a part of the Howell Area Fire Authority. This Authority is composed of the townships of Cohoctah, Howell, Oceola, Marion, and the city of Howell. To split this fire authority into two different districts for our congressional district, state representative, or state senator would be devastating to our representation. I believe that when you draw lines the fire districts and police districts are critical and must be considered as a community of interest that is meaningful. I would urge you to require your software developer for drawing maps to start entering this data so that when maps are drawn you can quarry to see if any fire departments are split up.  I would like to comment on the provision in the Michigan Constitution, Article IV, Section 6 (13)(d), which states, “Districts shall not provide a disproportionate advantage to any political party. A disproportionate advantage to a political party shall be determined using accepted measures of partisan fairness.” This provision is fraught with many legal problems and will probably result in many different lawsuits. As I view this language, you have to draw the lines in such a way as to make it as close to 50-50 based on political parties. Perhaps there are other ways to construe this language. This could result in the city of Detroit having spokes going out into the suburbs and dilute the Civil Rights Voting laws. How are you going to make the city of Detroit such that it's not disproportionate to strongly elect democrats? Likewise, how will you do the same for northern Michigan so that it's not dispropionate to republicans? Most of the comments in your hearings on “communities of interest” are against “spoke-like” districts in favor of more compact districts. Also, what are “accepted measures of partisan fairness.” I have not heard an in-depth discussion in regard to this provision. Please don’t neglect this provision and what it means to draw districts.  I don’t understand why the commission is putting all its focus on having the Michigan Supreme Court constitutionally change dates specified in the redistricting provisions of or constitution. I hope that the commission is working with our congressional representatives to get the census bureau to release final numbers before the September 30, 2021 date, so that Michigan and similarly situated states can meet their constitutionally mandated deadlines. The proposed commission dates fail to allow communities the time to challenge the numbers released by the census bureau. This will potentially result in their community being underrepresented. My understanding was the Trump administration was planning to release the census data in March 2021. The Biden administration says it needs 6 more months. This begs the question, why? Are the census members being manipulated to give one political party an advantage over another political party? Is the census bureau cooking the books so to speak? I have a feeling the State of New York will find the 86 additional residents to avoid losing a congressional representative. The only thing this delay is achieving is to give the incumbents a huge advantage.   Finally, everything the commission has done and is doing has been open and transparent. Why does your public comment section on your website not require a commenter to disclose where they live? Everything you’ve done up to this point has been great. Now all of a sudden requiring someone to disclose where they live must remain secret. Again, one has to wonder why? What is it that you want hidden from public view? (I agree with not disclosing email addresses).  Again, thank you for your time and consideration to my communities of interest and other concerns.  Sincerely, Mark Fosdick Fowlerville, MI. 48836  "
988,written,,senior citizens,In support of the MI Redistricting Comm.,"At one time, the principle of ""One Man, One Vote"" was the law. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 helped to ensure that every Citizen was included in the election process. In the recent past, the United States Supreme Court eliminated the enforcement provisions of that legislation, which weakened the effectiveness of that law. Moreover, the unchecked gerrymandering practices in several states have undermined the ""One Man, One Vote"" principle.  Hopefully, Congress will pass those Acts aimed at restoring equal rights and equal access to the voting process. Here in Michigan, we can do our part by save guarding against the gerrymandering of districts so that every vote has the same weight. "
989,written,,,Why wholly new district maps are vital,"It is vitally important that the Commission throw out all the currently existing electoral district maps and start from scratch in drawing new lines. Overall proportionality (keeping each district as close as possible to the ideal number of residents), geographical contiguity, and continuity of communities of interest are the three most important criteria, by far, in creating new districts. Though politics has become a defining factor in individual and community identity, it is equally important that ""communities of interest"" be defined in non-partisan terms, as far as is humanly possible. Our districts should reflect our shared values, and not accentuate our competitive political instincts. I was a volunteer signature gatherer for the ballot proposal that created the Michigan ICRD. I spoke with hundreds of people about the need for, and the nature of, the Commission. Many people I spoke to signed the petition; many did not. Not more than five out of the over 300 people I personally spoke with expressed a desire to keep things the way they are. The people of Michigan voted overwhelmingly for this Commission; they understood the unfair absurdity of allowing elected officials to draw the maps governing their own elections. The people of Michigan voted for change; for free and fair elections; for new electoral districts.   Thank you, members of the Commission, for you time and your hard work. This is a vitally important task if our democratic system is going to survive. "
990,written,,,Municipal Boundary Plan,"Municipal boundaries (county, city, and township boundaries) best reflect communities of interest. Municipalities best reflect and represent the needs of their residents and voters. Voters locate to and stay in municipalities based on the governance and policies of that municipality.     The US Supreme Court has ruled numerous times that using race, ethnicity, religion, and other suspect classes as the predominant factor in drawing district lines is unconstitutional and discriminatory. The US Supreme Court has been most critical of and applied the most scrutiny to using race, ethnicity, religion, and other suspect classes in drawing district lines. Using race, ethnicity, religion, and other suspect classes in drawing district lines divides our communities of interests and hurts the voters of those communities.  Drawing districts based on municipal boundaries promotes a fair-minded, neutral, and non-partisan plan in compliance with the Michigan and US Constitution. "
991,written,,,Redistricting of NW Michigan,"June 30, 2021  Dear Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission.  Thank you for taking my testimony.  As a resident of Leelanau County, it has been apparent to me that gerrymandering in Northwest Michigan has lead to the lack of equitable representation of the voters in the State Legislature.  I volunteered to collect signatures for the Voters Not Politicians group to end gerrymandering in Michigan and to make sure that our legislators are chosen by the people—to be accountable to us. Your work in making sure all voters are represented in our elections is very important and I thank you for stepping up to this task.  For the last several years, my family and I have become aware that our State Senator and State Representative are not looking out for the best interests of the people who live here but rather are deeply influenced by corporate money and corporate interests. We frequent their coffee hours (both in person and online), call their offices, and write and e-mail them frequently and provide feedback on various issues and bills that come up before the State Legislature. We feel our thoughts, opinions, experience and passions are ignored.  I encourage you to start anew and when you look at our legislative district maps, to endeavor to make it as equal and balanced so every citizen’s voice here carries equal weight.  After all, why should my voice count more than my neighbor’s voice simply because of my political party?  Aren’t we all better when we become an active member of our community? Having representation that actually understands the needs of our community and listens to how bills and legislation impacts our lives is the the best possible outcome.  In addition to the obvious geographic proximity, Leelanau County has a lot in common with the northwestern part of Grand Traverse County other ways: commerce, transportation, health care, tourism, agriculture and demographics to name a few.  When you are looking at Leelanau County, it makes sense to also look at the similar characteristics of northwest Grand Traverse County as well. And to take these factors into account in your redistricting maps.  I ,and my family, look forward to a time when government works for the people and your good work will help make that happen.  Sincerely,  Victoria Gutowski 8625 S Lakeview Road Traverse City, MI 49684 (Leelanau County, Elmwood Township) 231-421-8858 "
992,written,,,Fair redistricting,"Thank you for taking my written testimony.  This isn't hard.  Voting districts should not look like octopuses laying on top of each other, meandering through streets and neighborhoods just in order to secure a specific outcome.  Draw the maps as square/rectangle as possible, don't cut through big cities in order to weed out specific voters, and MAKE IT UNBIASED.  There.  I fixed it.  Damn.   This isn't rocket science!    Thank you for everything you are doing to address this issue.  Why we ever find ourselves in this situation is beyond me.  But you are heroes for being there, taking the time to address it.  I'll be paying attention to how the districts are redrawn."
993,written,,,Joanne Cromley - Cheboygan County Plan,"Cheboygan County is directly connected to our neighbors by both land and water, and we want to make sure our voices as a community of interest are represented properly for the next 10 years or more.  The Inland Waterway directly connects Cheboygan and Emmet counties, the Sturgeon and Pigeon River connects Cheboygan and Otsego counties.     ·       We have no hospital, so must travel to Emmet, Mackinac, or Otsego for care.  ·       As with most rural areas of Northern Michigan, broadband access is an issue  ·       Tourism is absolutely dependent upon a direct relationship with other counties.   ·       Cheboygan County residents regularly travel to Emmet and Otsego counties to purchase goods and services that are not available here  ·       Cheboygan County is similar in age and income demographics to counties like Presque Isle and Mackinac  ·       The Straits of Mackinac shoreline encompasses both Emmet and Cheboygan counties.   ·       If something were to happen to Line 5, it would be a direct disaster for Emmet, Cheboygan, Charlevoix, Mackinac, and Presque Isle counties.     ·       Our county has been divided (and not neatly) into two State House districts for the last 10 years.  It is confusing to residents, and dilutes our county vote."
994,written,,,Western Washtenaw County,"I am age 65 and I live and farm in Freedom Township. I believe that the new district boundaries should better reflect our community of interest than they do currently.  The current state senate 22nd district does not reflect the community of interest for western Washtenaw county. We have very little in common with Livingston county. I feel that Jackson county would better reflect the western Washtenaw community of interest because it also is mostly rural and in addition to the I-94 corridor, it shares in our issues and concerns, including protection of the environment and the need for increased broadband access.  The current U.S. house 7th district boundaries also do not reflect the community of interest for western Washtenaw. I see no good reason to split Washtenaw county. A more compact district encompassing more of Washtenaw county and the I-94 corridor would make more sense.    Thank you for your consideration and for your service."
995,written,,,Cass County Community of Interest,"I have lived and worked in Dowagiac and Cass County for most of my life and was happy to be able to retire here several years ago.  One of the best things about Dowagiac and Cass County is its proximity to a variety of medical, recreational, cultural, and social resources, the majority of which are located in Berrien County.  Dowagiac is a lovely town, but I do most of my major shopping in Niles, St. Joseph (MI), or Benton Harbor.  Most of our doctors and medical offices are within the Spectrum Healthcare System in Niles and St. Joseph.  We are about a 30 minute drive to the beautiful Lake Michigan.  Several Southwestern Michigan wineries are just outside of Berrien Springs and Buchanan.  Lake Michigan College is home to the Mendel Center, which provides educational, musical, and other cultural events for our enjoyment.  Most of our activities are directed to the west of us.  I believe that many of my fellow residents in Dowagiac and Cass County are similarly disposed.  Throughout the years, Cass, Berrien, and VanBuren Counties have been joined in several “Tri-County” initiatives, two of the most notable being Tri-County Headstart and MiWorks! (Berrien/Cass/VanBuren Counties).  Cass County no longer has its own county health department but is now part of the Cass VanBuren Counties Health Department.  All of these collaborations speak to a community of interest for Cass, Berrien, and VanBuren Counties.  Additionally, the Potawatomi Tribe covers Cass, Berrien, VanBuren, and Allegan Counties, not St. Joseph County, MI.  A Representative in the Michigan House who knows and appreciates these commonalities would certainly be in the best position to serve interests of the citizens of Cass County.  I supported and worked for passage of the ICRC amendment in 2018, and I am grateful that each of you has been willing to serve to make the redistricting process as fair and equitable as possible.  I know that you will be trying to balance many competing positions and that will be a difficult juggling act.  Good luck to you and thank you for your dedication and service."
996,written,,,Prison Gerrymandering,"Currently prisoners are counted in the district where they are imprisoned. This is wrong. It encourages people to imprison others. Also, when people are released, they are released to the community they came from, unless there are unusual circumstances.   Prisoners need representatives who support their interests. They should either be allowed to vote, or they should be counted in the community from which they came."
997,written,,,Livingston County,"I would respectfully request that Livingston County remain wholly independent from the surrounding counties.  Although at first blush, one would presume I'm requesting this out of political motivation, I would suggest otherwise.  Livingston County's has a unique atmosphere where the old wisdom of the farmers combines with the avante garde experiences of the younger generation.  People have relocated here to raise their families because we offer a lifestyle they cannot find otherwise.  We are not industrialized; but rather a bedroom community.   Because of that, our values and requested legislation would be different.  I was born and raised in Livingston County.  My parents and my family have worked here and dedicated our lives to serving the citizens of this County.  We have worked hard to preserve a certain manner of living that only our County offers.  Additionally, as Chief Deputy County Clerk, I have concerns of a professional nature.  In our elections division, a division of our county would require multiple ballot styles for elections, which would create unnecessary expense, hardship, and misunderstandings for the electorate.  A goal is always to have as few ballot styles as possible.  When a ballot contains more races and issues, we necessarily must go to longer ballots, which creates unnecessary expenses.   As it stands, our state representative is wholly contained in Livingston County.  They are able to come into our local Clerk's office for their filings and we are able to give them face-to-face service.  If that race were to straddle county lines, their filings would go to the Secretary of State.  It's virtually impossible for them to receive face-to-face service at their office.  On our court side, we are consistently seeing new legislation that is against the grain of values of this community.  I spend many hours each month following proposed legislation concerning courts and laws and writing to my legislators of my concerns.  Because they are local and are well aware of the values of our community, these concerns are heard - where other legislators who do not live in a community with the same values and concerns give my correspondence little attention.    If, for some reason, you were to combine a portion of our county with another, I would humbly request that you join it with Shiawassee as that county is most like ours.    Cordially,  Kristi Cox Chief Deputy County Clerk, CCM (CCE pending) Livingston County, Michigan 44th Circuit Court"
998,written,,,Districts that promote moderation,"Districts that contain approximately equal numbers of both Democratic and Republican voters would require politicians to adopt moderate positions that might appeal to both.  Also, voters in such districts would feel that they have a real possibility of electing their preferred candidate, and would be at least somewhat represented by the winning candidate."
999,written,,,"""Communities of Interest""??","The point of this Commission, and why the voters approved it, was to adjust geographical voting boundaries in a manner in which the current political party (regardless of which party) did not have an overwhelming say in the matter. It was not to come up with voting jurisdictions based on ""communities of interest"". Regardless of the intent, it smacks of political leanings, and will undermine the public confidence of this Commission. Please keep it simple. Redraw the geographical lines as needed, with the least political influence as possible. This is what the voters approved."
1000,written,,,DO the Right Thing = Every Vote Heard!,"Good Day Commission Members,  As you continue with this unique and daunting opportunity for Michigan, please keep in the back of your minds that the rules/expectations are great guidelines but some districts may NOT fit into the Glass Slipper so easily. Some districts-locations-taxpayers-VOTERS need to have full access to participating and voting for their leaders and representatives without any implicit biased regulations, laws and poll processes from our current polarized two-party system. If you literally follow all the rules and requirements of your charter to develop the new 13-district Voting Map, then I believe you will diminish numerous opportunities to ensure collaboration, discourse, effective decision-making and trust in Michigan's election process. Our current Lansing leaders, ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE, are selfishly and hypocritically not moving Michigan forward to permit each of  Michigan's citizens and tax-paying guests to learn and live in achieving their OWN PATH to prosperity.  Somehow, only two parties/agendas seem to believe their red or blue paths are the only ones that will lead individuals to achieve life's successes. Be ""Braver Angels"" to develop a map that will permit full discourse, AURA, respect and trust for every Michigan voter/voice to develop, and PASS, real legislation that provides LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL!! "
1001,written,,,Michigan’s 2CD is terribly gerrymandered,"Michigan’s 2nd Congressional District is terribly gerrymandered.  It is well known that the map is drawn to give the Republican candidate a clear advantage.  I suggest you consider the non-partisan Cook PVI for each congressional district to determine if it’s fairly drawn or not.   From Wikipedia:  “The Cook Partisan Voting Index (abbreviated CPVI or PVI) is a measurement of how strongly a United States congressional district or state leans toward the Democratic or Republican Party, compared to the nation as a whole, based on how that district or state voted in the previous two Presidential elections.”  PLEASE try to make every congressional district as balanced as possible to ensure that any party has equal opportunity to win so that the candidate with the best ideas and policy positions wins the vote…not the one with inherit bias in the boundaries of the district.  Specifically, Ottawa County voting swamps voting in most other 2CD counties this meaning “how Ottawa County goes, 2CD goes”"
1002,written,,"montague,whitehall,white lake area,muskegon county,watersheds,state house districts",Margot's corrected testimony June 29,"On June 29 in Muskegon, I presented oral testimony.  Here is my written version of it, with one correction.  In the oral one, I mistakenly said “ Congressional District” instead of “State Representative District.”  Here, without the nervousness of being at a microphone, I have made that correction. I am Margot Haynes (legal name Margaret E. Haynes) from Montague, Michigan. I would like to present three points focused on “Communities of Interest” related to State Representative redistricting. 1)	Water divides us historically, as with Montague and Whitehall—see Dan Yakes’s recent two-volume history of our area called Cross River Rivals.  But it also unites us in needing life and good health.  I support the gentleman who submitted the geological watershed map showing watershed areas of Michigan.  I believe the Commission should consider watershed connections, too, as part of communities of interest.  For example, upstream pollution from large farms can affect residents downstream near the lakeshore. 2)	County divisions are not necessarily reflective of “Communities of Interest.”  Muskegon County is drawn very strangely, as if gerrymandered itself, so the Commission should look at counties more as historical artifacts than as true communities in the present. 3)	In particular, I feel strong opposition to the current [MI State Representative] district in a backwards C which separates the White Lake Area from North Muskegon and the City of Muskegon but ties us into a far southern area of Muskegon County called Norton Shores.  Montague and Whitehall are towns of tourism and small agriculture, historically, with much in common with other lakeshore areas to the north as well as inland areas to the east, not the commercial powerhouse of Norton Shores, which is closer to Grand Haven (Ottowa County). If I had had more than two minutes, I would have added that originally White Lake was part of Oceana County, while Muskegon and south were part of Ottawa County, according to historian Dan Yakes (cited from his introduction to The History of Muskegon County in the Muskegon County Directory published by County Clerk Nancy Waters’s Office).  When the new county Muskegon County was inserted between Ottawa and Oceana counties, in 1859, Grand Haven wished to be in a different county than the city of Muskegon, which was becoming a rival to its pre-eminence.  Therefore, Muskegon City and the little towns to the north up to Montague and Whitehall were forced into a new county, Muskegon County (personal communication from Dr. Yakes on June 29, 2021).  But culturally and economically, our two small towns are very close to Oceana County, with ties of tourism and agriculture.  And we certainly have very little to do with south Muskegon County area of Norton Shores! "
1003,written,,,Linda Hrcka's Redistricting Comments,"										June 29th, 2021    To:  The Independent Citizens Redistricting Committee  I would like to make some suggestions for redistricting the state of Michigan after the 2020 census.   I belong to the 85th House district, the 24th Senate district and the 4th US congressional district.    I feel strongly about maintaining communities of interest, i.e. communities that share cultural or historic characteristics or economic interests.  Shiawassee county is primarily rural with agriculture, small business and businesses related to the automotive industry making up the largest part of the economic base.    I also believe that resdistricting should respect municipal lines, rather than roads or other divisions.   Neighborhoods, counties and townships should all be included in whole whenever possible.  I believe this is the best way to compactly define communities that are homogenous and deserving of representation.   I have been happy with the representation we have received from the current districts.  I believe that cracking should be avoided.  Each area of the state of Michigan should have equal representation in government to ensure that their interests have a voice.    Sincerely,  Linda Hrcka Resident Shiawassee County "
1004,written,,,Keep Lenawee Intact,"While the amendment to form this Commission is a step in the right direction, it's concerning that the language was not made more clear to the voters as it applies to the priorities when drawing the districts. Allowing Communities of Interest (CoI)  to supersede existing governmental boundaries (ranked 3rd and 6ht out of 7 respectively) is subversive and divisive. Additionally, from my Deputy Clerk experience, this makes voting more confusing and more costly to all citizens. Furthermore, all CoIs should be disclosed as to their commonality. I can't imagine what our sections of Lenawee have in common with the other two proposed districts.  I oppose any attempt to divide any county that falls short of the mean population index."
1005,written,,,District shapes,"Because it's much harder to gerrymander without manipulating the general geometric shape of a district, my suggestion is that, whatever the shape chosen - square, rectangle, triangle, circle - the only thing that should be changed is the size of the chosen geometric shape, to account for population density.  The current shapes are - entirely by themselves - an indictment of the political corruption of the earlier drawing of district lines, regardless of which party drew them. If lines are drawn in any other fashion, the commission should be very prepared to offer a detailed description as to why the above idea wasn't more fair. Thank you very much."

1008,written,,,Lakeshore communities,"I would like to address the special needs of the Lakeshore communities and the importance of having representation that understands those needs and will have those needs at the forefront as they consider legislation, budgets, etc. It is important that continuity of representation is maintained among these communities.  The economies of the lakeshore communities have similar needs and concerns , including harbor maintainance and dredging, marinas with pleasure craft,  charter and sport fishing. These communities have to deal with the influx of  summer visitors as a city of 10,000 can grow to 100,000 of more for an event and infrastructure, public safety,  restaurant’s, all have to be able to accommodate that influx,  and then  deal with the decline in the off season.   Its important that representation understands these dynamics and the great influence they have on the health and vibrancy of the communities on the Lakeshore. It is imperative that these needs are understood and addressed by representation. It must be in the forefront of their thinking and so that continuity of representation is vital.   Even though the lake gets much of the focus of the area, industry and manufacturing are dynamic parts of the Ottawa, Muskegon County area with many unique industries finding a home here and employees  drawn from the local labor pool.  Agriculture is also a big part of our economies with Ottawa, Muskegon and Oceana, as well as Allegan counties being huge in the farming community with their production of fruits and vegetables and nursery stock continues be a large and growing part of the economy.  The communities of these counties are tied closely historically and have a great working relationship  whether it involves tourism, manufacturing or agriculture. We have it all, so it is vital that our representation continues to be well versed in all of these areas and that we can continue the unity that we have and that we are not split apart into separate districts.

I have seen Wyoming grow from a township, to a city, to a diverse community becoming Kent County’s 2nd largest city. Economically balanced, it is more than a bedroom community, it’s an economic powerhouse from medical: (University of Michigan Health/Metro, industrial; Brillcast, and service: UPS and food supplier (Gordon Food Service. ) Along the way it has shared growth with Grandville MI which has grown and developed. Wyoming township viewed the development of cities in Grandville (1933) and Wyoming (1959).  We share a water/sewer system, mass transit, school placements, library services, police dispatch and churches.  This common identity recommends the combining of the City of Grandville and Wyoming into a common Michigan House district. Both cities shared a representative, Jelt Sytsema in common from 1969-1986.  Both cities have comparable city government models.  Common activities and contiguous borders make the case for a common district—we share a common identity, origins and relationships. Residents constantly cross over boundaries for jobs, recreation and cultural and leisure time activities. Jim Ward "
1010,written,,,Keep Ottawa County Intact,"Members of the Redistricting commission   I respectfully ask the commission to keep Ottawa county intact as it is as a voting district.  Ottawa County is the fastest growing county in Michigan.  There is a reason for that.  As the old adage goes, “if it ain't broke, don't fix it.”  It is obvious why people are moving here.  The lake shore is breath takingly beautiful.  Throughout the county you will find small town charm with all the amenities of the city.  The people who live here are friendly, the economy is strong, and our communities are safe.  It is a great place to raise a family.    To have fair district lines, requires fair representation.  Regrettably, West Michigan has no representation on the committee.  To ask the committee to redistrict Ottawa County without the benefit of the experience of living here, is neither fair to the county or the committee.  It is like asking a podiatrist to perform heart surgery.  Sure, the podiatrist is a doctor, but he knows nothing about heart surgery.    So again, I respectfully urge the committee to not fix what is not broken and leave Ottawa County intact."
1011,written,,,Do not use U of M redistricting plan,"I urge the Commission NOT to use the redistricting methodology advocated by the University of  Michigan.  This is a theoretical exercise which would be impossible to operationalize in ""real-life"" -- something that the people who wrote the proposal have no experience doing.  It's just another attempt to define everyone by a label and segregate them in that way rather than recognizing the importance of physical community.   Redistricting should be based on geographic considerations, not trying to meld together religions, ethnicities,  etc into ""communities of interest"".  How would that even work on a practical level, e.g. voting?  Elected officials must be able to represent the needs of physical communities which differ greatly within our state.

1012,written,,,Mt. Pleasant and County Need Change,"Having lived in Isabella County and Mt. Pleasant for 50 years,  I believe that I am a genuine victim of gerrymandering. The 4th Congressional District, the 33rd State Senate District and 99th State House District have been gerrymandered to insure that Republican candidates win. Except for  a 1979 to 1985, when a Democrat served in the U.S. Congress, my fellow Democratic citizens have lived in a virtual ""one party state,"" as far as state legislative and U.S. House representation is concerned. The elected politicians,  beneficiaries of the gerrymandered system, govern according to values, priorities, and policies contrary to what large numbers of their ""constitituents"" believe in and support.  The undemocratic consequences of this half century state of affairs are too numerous to list exhaustively but a few of the more important are:  (1) lack of accountability, since those in safe seats can and do largely ignore input from different points of view; (2) difficulty in recruiting opposing candidates, because running against entrenched incumbents in a rigged system is seen as a ""lost cause;""(3) compounded with term limits at the state house and senate levels, same party representation leads to lax recruitment by the dominant party resulting in lackluster, mediocre candidates since ""anybody can win."" Regardless of the outcome of the specific case of Mt. Pleasant and Isabella County, we need to strive to meet a standard of at  least a 45% to 55% degree of competiveness in our Congressional and state legislative districts in Michigan. This would a least ameliorate the foregoing evils as well as many others, inflicted on us by gerrymandering. Another cost of gerrymandering in my area is the fracturing of communities of interest. Isabella county is lumped together with other counties or parts of counties with which it shares little in terms of economic interests, and cultural values. For example, Midland county has a large scale multinational industrial corporation, Dow Chemical, while no counterpart exists in Isabella County.  For the last three decades the 4th Congressional District seat has been occupied by individuals with direct, even familial, ties to Dow. Also, Midland county is a hotbed of  extreme political conservatism, as manifested by the Mackinaw Center, and Northwood University, both bastions of conservative libertarian ideology. And, Midland county contains largescale politically and socially conservative evangelical churches while Isabella County does not. The community of interest that is visibly significant is Mt. Pleasant is that of higher education. Not only Central Michigan University but also the largest campus of Mid Michigan Community College are located there. Politically the city of Mt. Pleasant and surrounding Charter Township of Union have become characterized by politically progressive governments. The 99th state legislative district should be changed to merge Isabella County and northern Gratiot County, the location of the city of Alma and Alma College. The direction of redistricting needs to go South, not East. "

1014,written,,,Voting rights,"To whom this concerns, The proof of gerrymandering is in the outcome. Our state of Michigan is on the top of the list of states who’s party that received the majority of seats, received a minority of the votes. Is it a wonder that citizens are disgruntled and discouraged? Votes did not translate into voices being heard, and constitutes being represented. On top of that, the minority voted in politicians created bills to further suppress and  obstruct voting. Packing numbers of citizens of the same political party affiliation in geographic blocs, (this happened to Democrats in 2010), which diluted their numbers in other districts, and Democrat voting strength was diluted. This was found by the court to violate the First Amendment right to association and Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection.

1015,written,,,Mason County Should not be Divided," I’m from Mason County and request that the new redistricting map leave Mason County intact and whole so that we may continue to work together for our common social and economic interests. Mason County is within Congressional District 2 which is bordered on the west by beautiful Lake Michigan which is comprised of many resort communities supported by tourism; bordered on the east by verdant agricultural areas and on the south by manufacturing.   Mason County echoes this mix– within Mason County is the city of Ludington, the county seat, a rural resort community bordered by Lake Michigan on the west; verdant agricultural land to the east and manufacturing to the south  Within Ludington is Hamlin Township, which is splintered into two precincts which makes no sense to the residents or the Township Manager.  People are unsure of which group they belong to and it thwarts our sense of community and cooperation in our common social and economic interests for our Township.  It’s awkward.  We ask that any redistricting required by changes in population be done with great care to continue to allow Mason County to remain whole; to protect the unity we have in preserving the scenic character of our area, on which tourism depends; our open space value, our water quality and our sensitive wildlife environments.  Leave District 2 and Mason County intact so that we may continue to work together for our common social and economic interests. "

Lenawee County has a County Sheriff department that works with other city and village police departments in the county to provide police presence and protection for the county. The city of Adrian in the center of the county and is the county seat where the business of the county is conducted.  To split the county into numerous state representative districts will be disastrous for the county.

My name is Kim Gates.  I have lived and worked in Caledonia Township, Kent County, all of my adult life--over four decades.  It is a wonderful rural/semi-rural community that should be aligned with other semi-rural communities.  Residents here have chosen to live away from the bustle of the city and busy suburbs.                My State House District 86 currently crosses over the county line into Ionia County.  Certainly, when you are looking at communities of interest, the services of Kent County, including but not limited to the sheriff, road commission, Intermediate School District, courts, Dept of Public Works, correctional facilities, health department and parks should be represented in the State House within the boundaries of Kent County.  Please respect the boundary lines of the county when determining State House districts, starting with new maps instead of trying to tweak the old ones, which are unfairly partisan.               Our county is also split up among congressional districts because of gerrymandering.  Since Kent County is the fourth most populous county and Grand Rapids is the largest city in west Michigan and anchors the west side of the state, we need to have Kent County’s boundaries within a single congressional district.              Thanks, again, for your efforts to help Michigan get fair representation for all of its citizens. "
1019,written,,,"Geography-based, geography-limited ","I am submitting as a voter and citizen of Michigan. I was born, raised and have lived in Michigan all my life.  I am concerned about the results of this commission as to what it determines to be a ""community of interest.""  Any district needs to be geography-based and limited based on geography.  This is to assure there are clear lines, geographically, that voters can understand as to where they 'fit'.  If the districts overlap each other for instance, there is no clear line. If the districts are based on some ""flavor-of the day"" community of interest, there is no clear distinction as to what voters are in and what voters are out.  Also, what happens if voters' interests change? Does the voter get to choose which district they belong to then?  My other concern is what and who determines which interests make the most sense?  This cannot be based on ""flavor of the day"" issues that can change as time passes.  For instance, if a community of  interest had been created in the 1980's based on those concerned about acid rain, where would that community be today?  Districts need to be clearly defined and limited based on geographical mapping without overlapping so that voters clearly know who their representatives are so they can hold them accountable.  This doesn't exist right now, for example, in the City of Detroit where its council members are not based on districts within the city. Thus, they're accountable to no one, in essence, and the voters have very little say in how they're governed by those council members.  Whatever you do, to it with objectivity, non-partisan-based, and sustainable throughout the ages.  Do it in a way that voters clearly understand who represents them, and in a fair, non-political method, based on clear geographical lines of demarcation.  Thank you. "
1020,written,,,"Communities of Interest,  Grand Traverse","My Name is Whitney Roberts.  I am a resident of Elmwood Township in Leelanau County and a member of the township planning commission.  I am on the board of The Maritime Heritage Alliance.  I support the efforts of the Commission as you work toward establishing a framework for fair and equal elections.  I encourage the Commission to begin afresh to redistrict our state’s electoral boundaries.   I am particularly struck by the fact that we in Leelanau share so much waterfront and common issues with Grand Traverse, our neighboring county.  We would do well with common representation in the legislative systems of our state and nation.  We are more tourist driven than our present district partners of Benzie and the Upper Peninsula.  We exhibit the same pressures on housing and infrastructure as Grand Traverse and we share the common water which we seek to protect.  Our present representatives, state and federal, are confronted with a mix of urban and rural of agriculture and parkland making representation difficult.  While our present boundaries place us with more rural areas, the U.P. and Benzie, Manistee counties, we are a bedroom community to Grand Traverse and have more rapidly expanding villages to work with.  We share the common dependence on the waters of Grand Traverse Bay.  More accurate representation by our legislators would be helpful.  Our present, gerrymandered districts do not permit this.  Combining Leelanau County with Grand Traverse County or a portion thereof would certainly enhance the power of our electorate to protect our waters, respond to the ever increasing pressures of urbanization and enable more focused attention to our common problems.  Thank you  Whitney Roberts."
1021,written,,,Align interests and populations,"Thanks to the commissioners for this important work for Michigan's citizens.  I think the commissioners should consider logical connections between geographical areas -- preserving county lines when possible, considering the economic and social connections created by major highways, etc.  Isabella County, for instance, has many connections with Gratiot County to the south, for energy (the windmill farms) and for education (close ties between Central Michigan University and Alma College).  Businesses too benefit from the 127 corridor connecting St. Louis, Alma and Mount Pleasant.  These connections are both strong and historic, making a community of interest far beyond connections to the east.  The current 99th District doesn't make much sense geographically or economically.  I encourage the commissioners to avoid maps focused on voting habits and instead focus on the relationships and common interests of areas across the state. This will provide opportunities for more representative government for Michigan.   "
1022,written,,,Calhoun and Kalamazoo-E to W connection,"The current US house map (Congressional District 3)  for Calhoun County suggests that there is more of a north/south connection for Calhoun county.  However, Calhoun County has more connections with Kalamazoo County.  A shared United Way, shared airport, shared news sources, shared waterway (Kalamazoo River), shared university (WMU) all make a stronger connection between the two communities of Battle Creek and Kalamazoo more reasonable than the current alignments with Grand Rapids.  There is also a strong commuting community between the two communities along I-94.  The same is true for the state Senate seat.  Maps for representation should be reflective of community affinities and likemindedness.  "
1023,written,,,A Plan For Troy ,"Hello, I have been a resident of Troy, MI for 26 years.  The present 11th congressional district groups Troy with cities that are on the western and north western side of  Oakland county. That makes no sense. I would like to have Troy in a district where we can have a strong cohesive community. Even though I live in Troy, I, like many other Troy residents, spend a lot of time enjoying the shopping, dining and activities in our neighboring cities. Troy should not be grouped with cities where we share no common interests. A cleaner district would include a group of cities in a semi square encompassing cities along Interstate 696, Woodward Avenue and Interstate 75.  This would include Sterling Heights, Troy, Clawson, Madison Heights, Berkley, Royal Oak, Ferndale, Oak Park, Southfield, Beverly Hills and Birmingham. There are many parks and recreation activities that are conveniently located within our neighboring cities that we utilize.  And there are many local community events, festivals, and markets that are enjoyed by all residents in this community group. Connecting these cities will also strengthen the partnerships that our faith community share. Troy is a very diverse community, and it would make our district even better if you grouped us with these diverse and blended communities such as ours. Thank you for doing this difficult work. It is very much needed and very much appreciated."

1025,written,,"shiawassee,hazelton township,new lothrop ",Thoughts for Shiawassee County ,"To the Michigan Redistricting Commission,  As a Shiawassee County resident I am deeply vested in ensuring my Community of Interest remains intact and that long established local unity of government are given the highest consideration when drawing the lines.   It is my hope that when you consider the 2021 apportionment for congressional districts, state senate districts, state house districts, and county commission districts, that you please consider my statement.  Shiawassee County historically has been kept whole for redistricting purposes for the Michigan House and Senate Districts and a U.S. Congressional District meeting the redistricting criteria of Compactness. Contiguity, and the Polsby-Popper Score requirements. It also should rate a high Reock Score keeping to the area of the smallest possible circle redistricting requirement.   Shiawassee County also meets the redistricting criteria of Competiveness, incumbency, Pack and Cracking, and Partisan Fairness as historically the county votes in a way that can result in candidates from either party winning.   In the spirit of the Communities of Interest redistricting criteria that requires ""populations that share cultural or historical characteristics or economic interests"" be taken into consideration for redistricting. Shiawassee County share common culture and historical background with common economic interests. Shiawassee County is primarily rural with agriculture, small business and businesses that are automotive related making up the primary economic interests.   Our population here in Shiawassee County is 68,000 which is close to the 77-91,000 population requirement to be a Michigan House district by itself. The County is historically joined with a few townships from an adjoining county of similar cultural, historical and economic interests to make up a Michigan House District.   To redistrict Shiawassee County in a way that would divide it up electorally would artificially divide a population that would be detrimental historically, culturally and economically. I urge you to keep Shiawassee County as primarily its own Michigan House District and to keep it whole for the purposes of creating a Michigan Senate District and a U.S. Congressional District by combing it with other counties of similar cultural, historical and economic interests.   Thank You for taking this into your consideration. "
1026,written,,"plymouth,canton township,plymouthtownship,northvilletownship,northville,schoolcraftcollege,plymouthcantonpublicschools",Plymouth-Canton-Northville,"In your redistricting maps, I hope you will consider keeping Plymouth, Plymouth Township, Canton, Northville Township, and Northville together in the same district for state and congressional offices. Our three communities are intertwined geographically, economically, educationally, and socially.  Aside from sitting on the northwestern edge of Wayne County, we are also divided by I-275 from the communities to our east, creating a tighter interconnectedness between Plymouth, Canton, and Northville.  The most apparent linkage is the shared school district between Plymouth and Canton. We call ourselves Sister Communities, given how much we share in resources. Plymouth provides the downtown for Canton to enjoy, while Canton provides Plymouth the everyday shopping needs on Ford Road.  Many of our families and children think of our two communities as one.   Northville and  Plymouth also have many linkages that make us an excellent match. We both have central cities with thriving downtowns surrounded by Townships. The Townships are working together to redevelop the Five Mile Corridor between Beck Rd to Napier into the Michigan International Technology Center. This corridor is some of the last open land sitting on the western edge of Wayne County that can be developed to bring in high-tech, well-paying jobs to our communities. The Plymouth Township-Northville Township area already has hundreds of these companies who find our area highly appealing due to the engineering talent that calls our communities home.  hundreds of millions of dollars are already invested in the corridor redevelopment by by the State of Michigan, Wayne County, DTE, the Townships, developers, and large corporations.  Several years ago the City of Plymouth and the City of Northville combined to form one fire department. The fire and police departments share resources and support services.  All three communities also share the services of a local United Way and Salvation Army that make up our safety net for those in need. All the communities also feed into the Schoolcraft Community College System. There are also countless other community services we share together.   For the congressional and Senate seats, the three communities should be left together. At a State Representative level, it may be hard to keep all three together as a whole due to the population, but combining Plymouth with parts of the Northern Canton and southern Northville in Wayne County creates a district that lives and works together every day."

1029,written,,,Marquette Co. FAIR  plan,"The “fair” redistricting of Michigan will go a long way to restore fair and competitive districts across our State. From the inception of Proposal 18-2 “Voters Not Politicians”, myself and thousands of citizens in the Upper Peninsula have been in full support of the creation of this commission of citizens to redraw and adopt fair district boundaries for the Michigan Senate, Michigan House of Representatives and U.S. Congress.    	We are all well aware gerrymandering has led to a situation where Republicans have an edge that does not accurately reflect the leanings of the State as a whole.  I have lived in the Upper Peninsula for forty years and have witnessed the effects of gerrymandering, and how certain politicians in control have exploited Michigan with “Effective minority control” and  practices of diminishing the political power of minority voters, over the last 40 years. There is an increasing and disturbing trend of  leadership at the state level who are willing to take any advantage to ensure their party’s victory, even if it is in direct opposition to ethics, norms, laws, and even the will of their constituents. These individuals and groups are sowing distrust in our electoral process and are setting a dangerous precedent for our democracy. They have been in sole control of the redistricting process and are the reason why the commission exist today.  The Marquette County Democratic Party urges the MICRC to perform its constitutional mandate while safeguarding the process from these political intentions. These are our topics of interest for consideration by the MICRC:  •	Keeping Marquette County whole and bringing Powell and Ishpeming Townships back into the 109th •	The preservation of communities of interest must be taken into account when drawing electoral districts in an effort to enable these communities to elect representatives whose platforms or policy proposals align with their interests. •	Communities of interest in the UP tend to follow east/west routes, rather than north/south. For example, folks in Munising are more likely to travel to Marquette than Manistique. Manistique residents are more likely to travel to Escanaba (for things like Health-care/doctors, tourism, shopping, busing, travel, and commerce). Thus, our house districts should reflect these east/west corridors rather than north/south, and consider including Baraga county in the 109 th •	Additional Communities of interest in the UP tend to be Ethnic, racial, school districts, economic groups, tribal communities, etc. What we want to see in our newly established districts, is voter equity and true representation voting and how positive it can be for our communities.  As the Chairperson of the Marquette County Democratic Party representing thousands of voters in Marquette County, we most strongly urge the commission to fulfill its duties in good faith to meet the ultimate goal of determining fair districting for the state legislature and U.S congressional districts. Free and fair elections are the cornerstone of a healthy democracy, and redistricting a heavily gerrymandered Michigan to accurately represent its constituents and communities, will allow our great state to truly represent the will of its people.  Respectfully, Brian Kerrigan  Chairperson, Marquette County Democratic Party "
1030,written,,"cityofwayne,westland,waynecounty,tightandcompact,squarelines,safeseats,fairelections,constitutionalrepublic",Eliminate 'Safe Seats',"Representation in the United States Congress is geographically based as we know. ""The Founders of our country explicitly designed the House of Representatives to be an institution the reflects local and regional concerns"" (from The Historical Atlas of Political Parties in the United States Congress: 1789-1989).  Additionally, the role of the elected is to ‘preserve’ the rights we already have, given by our Creator, and to uphold the U.S. and Michigan Constitutions. Going with that--another point to consider is the discussion about ‘safe seats’. ‘A safe seat is one in which a plurality or majority of voters…support a particular candidate or party so strongly that the candidate’s election is practically guaranteed in advance of the vote’. (from The Case for a Better Election System, Amy Douglas).   Our government and elections were set up so that any person from a specific geographically area, with minimal qualifications, could step up, serve and represent their district in their respective city/township, county, state or at the federal level. Having a ‘safe seat’ is the complete opposite of that. Regardless of term limits, no one should have a district designed that they feel it is ‘safe’ to them or their party. Every election must have its fairness equalized, by ensuring candidates are voted in or out based on how well they served and represented the entire district.  As voters, we need to know our vote makes a difference and that we can change our representation if we choose, at every election. As citizens, we deserve representatives who are held accountable and earn our vote.  Thus, the need to keep municipalities together and in as many cases as possible, counties. This will provide a greater opportunity for competitive districts and for those wishing to serve, to feel they can, and for those elected, they need to listen to all of their constituents. "
1031,written,,,Amy's Educational Opinion,"First of all, thank you for tackling this major project - we are way overdue for combatting gerrymandering. Prior to logging in to this website, I looked up District 2 on the map of Michigan and was totally surprised to see the range of this district.  As a resident of Kentwood, I fail to see the ""community of interst"" that this current area covers.  It looks especially contrived in the Grand Rapids area.  Anyways, I would like you to give some thought to forming voting districts around school districts.  People often move to an area for their children to attend schools that reflect their values.  This might be a way to form voting districts based on communities of interest.  Un-gerrymandering is a huge but necessary task - thank you for your committment to the task, as well as allowing for our input. "
1032,written,,,End Gerrymandering listen to people ,"I have watched several of the Public Hearing Meetings by Zoom.  Gerrymandering is an inherently divisive policy that is historically documented to suppress the concerns of citizens living within a community and disconnected to the local elected officials because of the salamander design of the voters district.  Designed to keep an individual or party in office as the priority, not leading, not concerned about voter concerns, nor implementing policies that affect the quality of life of the citizen voter.  As the citizens voices are silenced on basic day to day concerns, dinner table issues, they lose confidence in their elected leaders, the system and any hope of meaningful changes that will improve their quality of life.  This dumbing down of Government and Civics curriculums in ""middle school"" began the injection of ignorance into the citizens consciousness, creating an uninformed citizen, unaware that this was planned action.  An action that pushed them into the arena of grievance politics and angry rhetoric.  Another by-product of this gerrymandering is a political system that requires the political leadership to spend a considerable amount of times and resources on raising campaign funds to stay in office.  This result is seeking out big money donors and illegal/dark money funds, to support their campaigns.  The big money gets their agenda on the table, discussed and laws to full fill their interest, not the community citizen voter.  The wishes of the majority of MI voters are to redraw the voting districts.  Listen to the people, the community citizen voters not corporate  and political leaders that have a selfish, me first, in debt to you for your cash donation and turn a blind eye to real time, real life everyday people concerns of representation.  Listen to the people not special interest.  Draw line with the uniting of communities in a similar location, that share, schools, shopping, recreation facilities, business/commercial districts,  and spiritual/religious institutions.  Draw lines with uniting of communities with common interest, mutual concerns; health care, public education, higher education , infrastructure, climate change, child care, living wages, and others.  Citizen voters are discusted with the system because leaders are not listening across the board on local issues and across the nation on federal issues and solutions.  The vast majority of Americans want; 80% gun safety laws,  80% better affordable health care, 90% no wars, 80% infrastructure physical and human, 70% social justice reforms, 80% increase living wage, 80% public education investments, etc.  yet our elected leadership chooses to ignore the polls, the will of the people.  Your commission can restore trust and truth back into the system and give the voter some stress release, that things will improve.  Your commission must create and win the trust of the people.  Listen to the People!  Currently the goals, focus and energies of politicians are to smother the vote, dilute/weaken the voter base, deprive the voter of a voice, a soap box, a forum to speak and be heard.  Currently the entire focus appears to only help the politician get re-elected and keep a job and not respect he people.  Gerrymandering allows the politician to select his voter not the voter select their representative.  Detroit must be designed to represent all of the citizens  within the city and then reach out to surrounding communities that boarder on Detroit.  The concerns of urban Detroit are overwhelming and should be addressed systemic, every Detroit citizen involved regarding electing officials.  Thank you for your service.  I hope this is a new day for the city, county, state and nation regarding, safe, fair, free elections that empower the citizen voter, return trust and truth to the election process and provide every citizen the resources to vote without barriers.  All of the eligible voters and younger citizens  that spoke during the public meetings are on the same page and want the same structural improvements to the system.  Across the board, across the state, young, old, all want change, that will improve the voting system not suppress nor smother voters rights.  "
1033,written,,,Funding and fairness,"Public education in Michigan for the last 20 years has been slowly and purposefully dismantled by a handful of ""Conservative"" special interests and politicians that unfairly had control of Lansing through district maps that were clearly partisan. The destructive agenda of these small group of right wing radicals is now quickly coming to an end, while we see a quick return to common sense in government. No more proof of this than Republicans in the State House urging the passing of a budget that strengthens funding for ALL school districts. This action clearly demonstrated a growing group of Republican lawmakers understanding the district map will no longer guarantee them election, but their actions will be the basis for continued representation. The non-partisan redrawing of voting districts is to put government fairly in the service of the people, which is one of fundamental bedrocks of our great country. Hopefully now, neither party will be able to use our children's future as a pawn in a political gain and then suffer no consequences on election day. Thank you for the great and noble work you do on behalf of our state and democracy."
1034,written,,,Redistricting using Townships,"I have put quite a bit of time into thinking of a solution to the gerrymandering dilemma and want to share my thoughts for a solution to the issue. The process I am proposing will require the program to be run 3 times. One time to determine Districts for the Michigan House, once to determine Districts for the Michigan Senate and once to determine Districts for the U.S. Senate. The major premise I am suggesting is the use of townships to determine boundaries.  Most of the townships are 6 square miles. There are over 1200 townships in Michigan. Thus, many townships may need to be combined in order to build a district. Fewer townships will be needed to build a district in such populated counties as Wayne, Oakland, Macomb, Kent, etc. My thought of determining the required districts is as follows. I propose to start at the northwest part of the Upper Peninsula and work downward. When at the bottom of the Upper Peninsula, move east and proceed northward. Repeat this process until the Upper Peninsula has been covered. In this manner each district will have a similar geometrical shape as the other districts. Treating the Lower Peninsula would continue where the Upper Peninsula left off. I would start at the Northern tip of the Lower Peninsula and again work west to east. At the eastern part of the state, I would drop down and move back west.  In order to keep the populations consistent across districts it may be necessary to split a township into two or more quadrants. The population by townships is available already and I am sure the state of Michigan would be able to have a computer program developed to supply the population by quadrant, no matter what the size of the quadrant was. Quadrants, within a township, would be important for townships with larger populations. However, using the same directional approach of west to east and then dropping south to the next quadrant would keep the districts as uniformly contiguous as possible. A computer program developed in this manner could be used every 10 years after a census was taken. It would need to be updated with the number of House and Senate members that were required in Michigan as well as the House in the U.S. The population grid for each township would also need to be updated. This method would provide a symmetrical layout of districts that removes politics from the process. Communities of Interest have been mentioned for this process. While they provide benefits for communities, they should not be permitted to alter the district maps for House and Senate elections. If used to alter district maps, that would begin to erode the maps and once again introduce gerrymandering. "
1035,written,,,Written Testimony,"Dear Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission   Thank you for giving me an opportunity to express my concerns. My name is Dana Getsinger and I live in Leelanau County but my mailing address is Traverse City, MI. Right away you might see the injustice.  I am a retired kindergarten teacher and kids were always discussing what is fair. Our maps for elections are not fair. Michigan’s 1st Congressional district was deemed by a Federal court to have been gerrymandered to favor Republicans after the last census. I would be heartened if Michigan choose to represent citizens fairly.    I am also concerned about communities of interest. Leelanau County has a lakeshore ties to northern Grand Traverse County and the citizens that live near Lake Michigan and Grand Traverse Bay may be considered a community of interest.  My grocery shopping is in Traverse City, My doctor and hospital are in Traverse City. My mailing address is Traverse City. It seems strange that the maps as they are drawn now exclude us from getting representation together. Health care, particularly hospital and specialists, are largely available only in Traverse City. The wine tours in our area include Old Mission in Grand Traverse and the wineries in Leelanau county.We share an intermediate school district with Grand Traverse. These 2 counties should be together for a Michigan House district.   I suggest you consider uniting Leelanau, Benzie, Antrim, Charlevoix and Emmet counties for a State Senate District. How better to protect our common water sheds.Water sheds are one of the main reasons for Communities of interest.  I ask for fair districts so that our representation in Congress and the State Legislature reflects the will of the voters.

1036,written,,,JURGS divides communities of interest,"There are some significant benefits of starting with regional approaches in redistricting.  However, when defining regions, the Commission should consider (and is legally required to consider) Communities of Interest.    The JURGS regions that divide much of Southeast Michigan along 8 Mile Road artificially divide some Communities of Interest where 8 Mile Road is not the relevant urban/suburban dividing line.   In fact, Northville and Grosse Pointe Shores are smaller cities that are literally cut in-two because they don't fit neatly within the county lines upon which the JURGS regions are based.  They are also each part of larger Communities of Interest of suburbs of similar character that cross county (and JURGS region) lines.  I have also seen testimony from individuals in certain immigrant/cultural communities that exist in more than one SE MI county.  To be clear, the MI Constitution places Communities of Interest as a higher priority than anything other than size, contiguousness, and VRA considerations.  Adopting a regional approach is generally understandable given the nature of the task that the Commission must undertake and the need to simplify it.  However, if it adopts that framework, it should do so with with certain amount of flexibility so that Communities of Interest that incorporate parts of more than 1 perceived/presumed region can be considered for common representation.  Thanks."

Grandville has been in the 2nd US Congressional District for many years - which makes absolutely no sense to me. The districting lines are jagged to include Grandville (again part of Kent County) in the 2nd District along with Ottawa, Muskegon, Newaygo, Oceana, Ludington and Lake Counties. I do not feel that Grandville should be included in the 2nd US Congressional District, and I strongly request that lines be redrawn to include Grandville with the rest of Kent County in the 3rd US Congressional District."

1039,written,,,Isabella-Gratiot,"Dear Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission:  Thank you for your willingness to serve on the redistricting commission. I appreciate your commitment to the challenging process of drawing fair legislative maps.  I am a retired math instructor who has lived in Isabella County for almost 40 years. During that time, I taught in Alma for 20 years, in St. Louis for 2 years, and at Delta College (campuses in Midland, Saginaw, and Bay City) for 9 years.  Consequently, I am extremely familiar with the counties adjacent to Isabella County.   This letter will focus on three points: •	Isabella County should remain intact in the State legislature and in the U.S. Congress. •	Isabella County should share a Michigan House district with its most comparable region, northern Gratiot County.  •	The current 99th House district, which links Isabella County with part of Midland County, needs to be restructured.  Isabella County consists of a small urban center surrounded by rural townships.  The boundaries of the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe reservation run through the city of Mt. Pleasant and through some of the townships. The city and county parks, the county transportation system, the Commission on Aging, and emergency services are used by all residents of Isabella County. The five local law enforcement agencies (city, county, tribal, university, and state) work together when needed. Isabella County is a unified community and should remain such in all legislative maps.  Isabella County and northern Gratiot County form a community of interest.  Having similar social service needs, Isabella and Gratiot counties work together through the United Way of Gratiot and Isabella Counties. The Gratiot-Isabella Technical Education Center offers skills training for area high school students.  The city of Alma in Gratiot County, like Mt. Pleasant in Isabella County, is a college town. The downtowns of Alma and Mt. Pleasant have a similar vibe, populated with locally owned restaurants and bars, a community playhouse, and other small business.  Both counties have wind farms and strive to protect the watershed shared by the Chippewa River in Mt. Pleasant and the Pine River in Alma. The ease of travel between Gratiot and Isabella counties makes it common for residents to shop in both counties.  Residents in these counties have a similar way of life; they need to be represented in the Michigan House by the same individual.  Midland County is home to Dow and Dow Corning. The County has a minor league baseball team and a tennis center equipped to host world-class tennis tournaments. Well landscaped, pristine downtown Midland has gourmet restaurants and heaters on the sidewalks in winter.  Midland County residents enjoy amenities typically found in large cities, including botanical gardens and a museum of science and art. Midland and Isabella counties are starkly different and belong in different State House districts.  A Michigan House district combining Isabella County and northern Gratiot County would provide our community the opportunity to have a representative who shares our mutual concerns.  Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.    Sincerely, Frances B. Lichtman   "

I certainly do not want to see our county cut up and have one township in one district and the one next to it in another. Avoiding have our county “snake around” other districts would be something I would value greatly.

However, these communities are split up by the US congressional district map based on county lines, with northern parts of Grand Ledge, Lansing, and East Lansing in district 04, while most of Grand Ledge is in district 07, and most of Lansing and East Lansing are in district 08. People in each city have common interests and it's cumbersome for the same city to have 2 or 3 representatives when the city is small enough to be contained in a single district."

1046,written,,,Maintain my current community integrity,"I was born and raised in Michigan and currently live in Oakland County, in the City of South Lyon. We chose South Lyon for it's rural community and hometown feel. I support local farmers and businesses to keep the integrity and ambience from becoming too commercial, and too main stream. I am very patriotic with hometown traditional Christian values and share these same views with those in my community. So therefore, I ask that you consider these concerns for the purpose of redistricting in the state of Michigan from the 2020 census, when determining the new congressional districts. *Fair maps *As much as possible, please keep the integrity of more rural communities, counties, cities and townships intact *Avoid taking parts of one community and redirecting to another district for Congressional or State legislative purposes *Prevent small rural areas of a county to be disproportionately assigned to larger more urban communities *Draw district boundaries that are clearly delineated by boundaries of intact communities "
1047,written,,, A True Community,"June 28, 2021  Dear Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission  Thank you for  taking and considering my testimony  My name is Darlene Doorlag . I am a retired teacher living in Lake Leelanau, MI in Leelanau County.  First I want to thank you all for the tireless hours and hours of work you have already put in  to your task and for all the future hours you will be putting in. This is such an important job and the voters are counting on you to be fair and equitable. I first ask that you start fresh with a clean, clear map and do not try to modify  any of the current maps.  Leelanau County and Grand Traverse County should be considered a community of common interests. We share an airport, a hospital system, an agricultural network, an entertainment connection,  as well as numerous festivals,  farmer’s markets, and a very successful farm to table collaboration. Our two counties share an intermediate school district and together attract thousands of tourists from all over the state and country. Our two contiguous counties should be considered a district together for a Michigan House seat.  In addition, I would like to see Leelanau, and Grand Traverse counties grouped together with the four contiguous counties of Charlevoix, Emmet, Benzie, and Antrim to create a  State Senate District. We share a Health Department with Benzie county, and together with Charlevoix, Emmett, Benzie, and Antrim definitely should be considered a community of interest. An example would be the sharing of  the cherry and wine industries  where many of our small farmers need the support of a coalition of these six  counties. In addition we  share  a community of tourism and we need each other to grow this very important industry. Both industries are so important to the economic interests of these six counties. If the commission takes into account how its citizens relate to each other when drawing district lines a fairness will automatically be created. In the past they were drawn to unfairly favor an incumbent or a political party. You have the ability to right this wrong.  Thank you so much for your time and service which I so greatly appreciate.   Sincerely,  Darlene Doorlag  2880 S Lake Shore Dr. Lake Leelanau, MI 49653 "

I live in the 37th State Senate, the 104th State Representative, and the 1st US Congressional Districts.   The job of redistricting Michigan is momentous with overwhelming significance for the future of Michiganders. I thank you for your efforts in advance.   The effects of constant Democratic versus Republican gerrymandering have sidetracked representation from what is good for citizens to what is beneficial for one political party or one person’s political career.   I have worked for the protection of Michigan waters for years. I believe the number one priority of the Michigan legislature should be to protect the Great Lakes that surround us. The Great Lakes represent the lifeblood of northern Michigan’s economy while providing  20% of North America’s fresh surface drinking water. Unfortunately, most elected officials in northern Michigan basically ignore or give only lip service to protecting the waters northern Michigan communities depend on.   Please start your work with fresh new ideas, open minds and a blank map. As you draw new district lines, emphasize what will encourage competitive, honest, straightforward elections.  I considered mapping my redistricting view, but found it well represented in the new districting lines submitted by Barbara Conley.     I wish you principled, open minded discussions focused sincerely on new district lines that best serve ALL Michiganders. "
1049,written,,,Communities of Interest,"The major individual interests and concerns are frequently different between urban residents, suburban residents, and rural residents, so they should be each considered as different communities of interest.

1050,written,,,simple principle for the basis of map,"I feel that the politicians  have done great damage to our citizens by their blatant partisan ans selfish actions in many ways and at many times. For a simple and basic step which I feel would be a good start to repairing the damage done,  I would like the northern and southern boundaries of all districts to be absolutely straight and parallel lines, and one of the two boundaries running north/south to be parallel to the earth's meridians.  I feel this concept should be adhered to absolutely, even though I understand there are practical and pragmatic reasons which may make this difficult. The reason for this is to remove the tiniest shred of any bias or unfairness. It also might totally prevent legal proceedings and challenges because districting done this way would plainly be totally impartial. I would hope that elected officials selected in districts mapped this way would be chosen because they display ideas for solutions and character traits which persuade voters that they are the best choices to serve our people and carry out the responsibilities of governing. I also hope that everyone would recognize that our state is making a commitment to virtue and desires honesty,  and justice. Maybe that would inspire our residents to examine and improve ourselves and attract idealistic people to come live here from other places. I want to mention is that people at our universities might be able to help draw the district maps using a field of learning I'm vaguely aware of having to do with the combination of mathematics and mapping.   I look at the present district boundary maps and am disgusted. I think the vote to create the citizens' commision shows many, many other voters felt the same way.   "

Thank you for what you are doing and the immense task you all have taken on to map out the state—this is no small feat.  While I understand population and other restrictions must be reviewed, I am in full support of keeping cities and townships whole and not divided to every possible extent you can. I also ask that the lines to define the districts be simple and clean, square and compact, rather than zig-zagging through and around.  Specifically, in Westland, the current state house district, the 16th district, is comprised of all of the city of Wayne and most of Westland. There is a small portion in the north east corner that is represented by a different house district—district 11. I have friends in that area of Westland who are not feeling represented and not understanding why we can live in the same city while not be represented by the same people.  Please keep all of the city of Wayne and all of the city of Westland together as one district. Both cities have residents with very similar goals, lifestyles and dreams.  Please keep natural community lines together across the state—do not break up the cities and townships and please keep the district lines compact and square as much as possible in the process. Keep the cities of Wayne & Westland together in one district. Thank you. "
1052,written,,,Authorities are Communities of Interest,"Hello, my name is Cardi DeMonaco Jr, and I am a member of the Eastpointe City Council.  You will be improving democracy. You will be creating a more perfect union. It was the founders of our country, never foreseeing this exact scenario, hoping that this would happen. One political party or another should not be drawing districts in our country and state. The people of the state should be drawing the districts, and finally will be.   Drawing districts that make sense, will not only make figuring out who your elected representatives are easier, but also make for a better democracy. When it's easier for the people to understand their government, it makes them more likely to get involved themselves. And the more people involved in their own democracy, the better. And when neighbors are represented by the same people, the more likely they are to get together and speak up. And when those representatives speak up and listen to others, we solve problems. And make this country a better place to live.   I am sure you have received hundreds, if not thousands, of comments by now. But the one specific suggestion for Communities of Interest that I have, is to take government authorities into account. Some cities share dispatch, like Eastpointe, Fraser, Roseville, and St. Clair Shores, some recreational authorities like Eastpointe and Roseville, some water, sewer, or landfill authorities, some other fiscal authorities. Consider those authorities, as those communities are already legally communities of interest. Some authorities will be more important than others for drawing districts, but I believe a more important one that an arbitrary boundary between two communities.  Please consider all of this when drawing districts for the US Congress, State Senate, and State House of Representatives. At a minimum, this will make a difference for ten years. But at a maximum, for the rest of our state and country's future. Please keep that in mind when doing the work of this commission!  Thank you!"

Because there has been gerrymandering in the past, I would like to ask that all maps start fresh with the specific criteria outlined in our stat constitution: equal populations, geographically contiguous, reflect the states diverse population and communities of interest with effort made to not split townships and cities as much as possible.  Finally, districts should not give advantage to any political party. Voters should be choosing the winner and the popular vote should reflect the winner, in most cases, if the districts are drawn fairly. "

1056,written,,,Voting Districts Boundaries,"Voting Districts should follow City, Township and County boundaries as much as possible.  Those are the communities of interest in our republic form of government.  Do not follow the recommendations of the University of Michigan report that creates new meanings of ""Communities of Interest (COI).""  UofM's new definition was not the intention of the voters when they signed the petitions and voted for this amendment.  The UofM definition and application of COI will only cause more division and less unity.  Their COI definition is arbitrary and political.  This exactly the opposite of what was meant by the signers of the petition and the voters who approved this amendment.   REDISTRICTING RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Consider carefully the Apol standards and its variations. Do not assume that these standards were repudiated in 2018 or that they contributed in any way to partisanship, legislative self-interest and self-dealing, or gerrymandering in the redistricting process. Do not close yourself to learning from past practice and historical experience. Although with exceptions, the history of Michigan has, by and large, been one of honest and responsible government.  2. Consider defining “communities of interest” exclusively on the basis of fair-minded, neutral, and non-partisan applications of “county, city, and township” boundaries. Every Michigan citizen is equally a member of such “communities of interest.” Once you begin to exercise increasingly broad discretion in defining and creating new “communities of interests,” you will inevitably begin to pit citizens and interests against each other. Resolving these disputes will inevitably place yourselves and the Commission into the type of political process the Commission was meant to transcend.  3. Consider carefully whether you wish to introduce explicit considerations of “race, ethnicity, and religion” into the redistricting process. Not only will such considerations come at the expense of other “races, ethnicities, and religions,” but such policies implicate our nation’s most profound and divisive issues. To paraphrase former U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, “When such lines are drawn by the State, the diverse communities that our Constitution seeks to weld together become separated, and antagonisms are generated that relate to ‘race, ethnicity, and religion,’ rather than to political issues.” A unifying legacy on the part of the Commission would be a momentous legacy.   4. Consider not exercising the Commission’s apparently limitless discretion to create new “communities of interests” under its “may include, but are not limited to” authority in § 13(c). This is truly the broadest-possible and most standardless delegation of power ever placed into our Constitution. The language does not reflect well upon the rule of law; do not let it also reflect poorly upon the Commission.  5. Consider carefully the wide variety of means, direct and indirect, obvious and subtle, by which legislators and political strategists have sometimes placed partisan and ‘selfinterested’ thumbs on the scales of redistricting justice. For Members of the Commission to do the same would be no step forward in the pursuit of good government. Avoid doing acts of partisanship, as well as acts that are tantamount or equivalent to partisanship.  6. Consider carefully the regularity of shape of the districts you construct. “Gerrymanders” are not simply oddly shaped districts, but encompass also districts of a more regular character, but with erratic and ‘squiggly’ indentations and protrusions undertaken largely to achieve political or partisan purposes.  7. Consider carefully before you add to the complexity of the redistricting process by the adoption of new legal concepts, new statistical measurements, novel types of “communities of interests,” amorphous political science terms, new ‘metrics,’ and pseudoscientific concepts of redistricting. None of this complexity and convolution will be necessary if the Commission views its responsibilities simply as the preparation of a “fairminded, neutral, and non-partisan” redistricting plan, rather than as “reimagining” representative government for Michigan.  8. Consider carefully the risk of nullifying or distorting express provisions of the Amendment, and thereby rewriting the Amendment, by an overly rigid application of the “order” of provisions, by reviewing Michigan Supreme Court decisions in this regard. See “Analysis: Priorities.”  9. Consider carefully whether the phrases and concepts you will hear from the ‘experts,’ such as “common bonds,” “affinities,” “shared characteristics, “communities,” “identities,” and “like-mindedness” are largely employed to divide and separate people, rather than to join them together and unify.  10. Consider carefully whether “communities,” “identities” “interests,” “groups,” or “populations” are more strengthened in the political process where their members are consolidated within districts or dispersed among districts. Then, consider carefully whether endless calculations of this sort are part of the proper and “common understanding” of the Commission’s work by the people of Michigan who ratified the Amendment. "
1057,written,,,Districting legitimacy,Districts should not be based on racial lines. That would be racist and illegitimate. Districts should be compact and not unnaturally distorted or stretched. If you distort districts for racial interests it will show that the process is politicized and illegitimate.
1058,written,,,Don't use communities of interest,"I don't agree with the new redistricting plan to separate voters according to a community of interest. Having a community of interest is a veiled attempt at drawing a boundary according to political affiliation. People who agree about a particular public policy will most likely be from the same political party. If so, the districts will continue to be drawn along party lines, just as they always have. The districts will just be called by a different name.  To truly make the boundaries nonpolitical, the state should be split up into rectangles with equal populations. This way, there will be a variety of different opinions among the constituents. The politicians will have to listen to a variety of opinions among those they represent. Then, they will have to justify to their constituents the reasons they voted as they did. Their job will be harder, because they will have to listen to more people, but hopefully it will result in more moderate voting, rather than being split along party lines. The current system of voting along party lines has resulted in more divisive and less civil public discourse. "

1060,written,,,Farming Community of Interest,"I am Galen Engel from Lenawee County, Adrian, Michigan (galen.engel@live.com).  I have been a life long farmer growing up here. My Great Grandfather from Germany settled on the southern edge of Palmyra Township in Lenawee where a road is named after the family. My Grandfather established a farm operation in Raisin Township on the border of Raisin and Palmyra Township in Lenawee County. My father with my grandfather established his farm in Palmyra Township on the same Raisin Township border. As a 76 year old life time farmer, I now continue the farming operation my grandfather and father began plus expanding this operation on my own. As you can see I have a great passion for agriculture in Lenawee County and the community I  live in. My farming operation does business with agricultural concerns and businesses in Lenawee and surrounding counties such as Monroe and Hillsdale counties. These businesses are seed, fertilizer, and chemical businesses as well as machinery dealerships, machine shops, and welding and fabricating companies. I also rub shoulders with many farmers and ag related business people throughout this tri county area. I am a member of the Lenawee Farm Bureau and participate in activities at the Lenawee County Fair. It makes sense to me that the people in government share my interests and have an understanding of the agricultural world I live in, whether it be my State Representative, my State Senator or my US Congressman. Therefore, I am asking that my concerns are at the top of your list when drawing up districts for all three public offices. I do not believe the interests of large urban communities would be sensitive to the needs of agriculture and the rural areas. I am well aware that agriculture is and has been one  of Michigan's leading industries and has played a huge part in making Michigan great."
1061,written,,,Prison Gerrymandering,"I just today learned about prison gerrymandering, wherein prisoners are counted as part of the rural districts in which they are incarcerated and not in the mostly non-rural cities and towns from which they were sent to prison.  This results in an artificial boost to population counts in the rural districts, and dilutes representation in cities and towns.  HB4276 and SB151 are being considered in our state legislature, which will end this practice.  However, even if those bills do not pass, it is still within the purview of the MICRC to consider ending prison gerrymandering on its own, using census data described here: https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/technicalsolutions2020.html.

1063,written,,presque isle,We need true Representation in our Area,"Dear Commissioners,       I want to thank you for the hard job you have ahead of you.   All I want is for the maps to be fair and at least represent the people living in them.   I was one of the signature gathers for Voters Not Politicians and it was the first time I had ever participated in such an action.  I felt so strongly that we needed to do something about what was happening in my Beautiful State of Michigan.   I have found that my area of Michigan,  in Presque Isle,  is not being represented like it should.  Presque Isle is a very rural area in the lower upper part of Michigan.   Farming, Lumber,   Limestone Mines as well as Moran Iron Works in Onaway is where the majority of jobs come from.   When the map for our State Senator  was drawn  in 2010 we were put in with Midland.    Our Senator is from Midland and does not represent our area at all.  I am a member of the League of Women Voters and we hold Candidate Forums.  In 2018 our Senate  Candidate was there and was asked about Proposal 2 (Voters Not Politicians- Gerrymandering)  Our Senate  Candidate said all he knew about it was that there were outside groups being paid to collect signatures.  This was an easily proven lie.  I can tell you I was not paid nor any of the others I knew who were collecting signatures.  We need to be in with areas  who deal with rural issues and not large city ones like Midland.  "

1065,written,,,Jennifer Fairfield State House District,"My name is Jennifer Fairfield, and I live in Bridgewater Township, in Southwest Washtenaw County. I am one of a group of citizens from Western Washtenaw County concerned about the redrawing of the districts for representation of Congress, State Senate, and State House.   Specifically, I want to address what is currently Michigan State Senate District 22, and my belief that the newly drawn district should run in an east-west configuration, containing portions of Washtenaw County and Jackson County, rather than the current north-south configuration of Western Washtenaw and Livingston County.  It is important to me that I am represented in the Michigan Legislature by someone who takes into consideration all of the aspects of the area that I live in, as well as the varied concerns of the citizens of this area. It is also important to me that all districts, to the extent possible, be drawn in such a way that does not give disproportionate advantage to any one party, so that the person elected must truly represent all the citizens in the district.  The reasons I believe that the district’s configuration should be made up of Jackson County and portions of Washtenaw County as a community of interest include:  •	Commerce – The major routes of commerce for Western Washtenaw County are not North/South between this area and Livingston County, but East/West between this area and Ann Arbor and this area and Jackson. The US Census Bureau’s OnTheMap Application shows that more people working in Western Washtenaw come from East/West areas by far, than do from North/South areas, and the same holds true for people who live in this area and work outside of it.  As a business owner in Chelsea, I see that most of the employees in my and other businesses in Chelsea are coming from Washtenaw and Jackson Counties. In addition, as evidenced by surveys we have taken during events in Chelsea we see that visitors/patrons/customers are coming from areas along I-94 in much larger numbers than they are from Livingston County.  •	Recreation – Western Washtenaw County is fortunate to have some beautiful recreation areas that it shares with Jackson County. The cities of Jackson, Chelsea, and Dexter are gateway communities to the Waterloo State Recreation Area, and as such share an interest in balancing nature, recreation, and commerce in respect to the area. The Big 400, a non-profit group whose mission is “to prepare and execute plans which stimulate commerce in the communities sharing a common border local and state public lands, while concurrently partnering with the stewards of these public lands to promote and encourage their use and preservation” works to promote such activities in this area, understanding the important ties between the communities. The Livingston County Convention and Visitors Bureau was originally included as a working partner with The Big 400, but dropped out of participating because they felt that their just was not enough in common between the two communities – they felt their community was more closely aligned with areas of Ann Arbor and Oakland County.  •	Broadband Deficits – While we have good Broadband service in many of our small to mid-sized cities, COVID exposed Broadband inadequacies throughout the area. Many residents (adults and children) have insufficient Broadband infrastructure, service, and accessibility. Doctors and hospitals, schools, and businesses (even in our small to mid-sized cities) discovered many of their students, employees, and patients were at a distinct disadvantage for: 1) Accessing telehealth solutions; 2) Participating in virtual learning (K-12 and college); 3) Working from home; 4) Starting or running a business and; 5) Adequately competing for employment opportunities.   I believe that the representative of a district including Jackson and portions of Washtenaw County for the Michigan State Senate would be best able to assure an evenly drawn district where representation would be proportional between the major parties, and incorporate our communities of interest in commerce, recreation, and our concerns for access to broadband. You will see from the map that I have submitted and the outline of the keys issues above that I have taken into account the requirements for an appropriate map.  I hope you will give serious consideration to my recommendation.   Attached:  Supporting data; sample map. "
1066,written,,,Livonia and Western wayne County,"My thanks to each of you for stepping forward to assume this challenging responsibility. If I were 20 years younger, I would have submitted my name for consideration. Having pondered the legislative apportionment issue since the writing of the 1963 Michigan Constitution and the U.S. Supreme Court decisions in Baker v. Carr (1962) and Reynolds v. Sims(1964), I do realize the complexity of the challenges you are facing.  The criteria stated in the 2018 ballot proposals that was adopted and is now part of the state constitution does offer guidelines that provide challenges to the most nonpartisan of individuals. Such court decisions as Thornburg v. Gingles add to the difficulty.  While my initial thought was to begin in the Upper Peninsula, adding counties to reach the required congressional district population of approximately 775,000 for each of the thirteen districts, I quickly realized the most challenging region of Southeast Michigan should be the starting point to create districts reflecting Michigan voting patterns. I believe the strongest form of  ""community of interest"" is the local community for congressional and state legislative districts.  As much as possible, I believe county lines should be observed.  In developing maps for the U.S. House and Michigan Senate and House districts, I urge you to establish boundaries preserving the unity of the City of Livonia. With an estimated population of 94,000, Livonia ranks as the 10th largest municipality in Michigan. As each of Michigan’s 110 State Representative districts will have a population of approximately 91,000, I realize these numbers will require a few Livonia precincts to be placed in a second representative district. Perhaps looking at school district boundaries (Clarenceville) might offer the best solution to this issue or perhaps the population of the city may fall within the legal guidelines of equity, thereby avoiding splitting off any precincts from one House district for all of Livonia.  UNITED STATES CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS—WAYNE COUNTY For developing boundaries for Michigan’s 13 congressional districts, I believe “Community of Interest” is best considered as conforming to municipal and county lines. Using an estimated population of 775,000 for each congressional district, all of Wayne County (1,757,299 east. 2019 pop.)  should include about 2.25 districts. Federal court decisions regarding majority-minority districts might impact line drawing and must be considered.   With a population of about 670,000 (2019 est.), Detroit needs to be combined with suburbs to the east (the Grosse Points, Harper Woods) and possibly along the Detroit River to include some Downriver community to reach the required population total. Western Wayne communities could form a complete district to reach 775,000 with the remaining communities in the southwest area of the county included in either Monroe and other counties to the west.  CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS—MACOMB AND OAKLAND COUNTIES The only two counties, along with Wayne, that will have at least one congressional district are Oakland, (1,253,185 est. 2019 pop.) and Macomb (870,326, est. 2019 pop.) Including communities along the St. Clair River in St. Clair County, should permit the creation of a third district with a common Community of Interest. The next district could include the Thumb counties and the Bay City/Saginaw River regions.  Oakland County could be divided into a full district on the east with the western area joining Livingston and perhaps Washtenaw Counties.  CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS—BEYOND SOUTHEAST MICHIGAN I would then focus on other large population counties as key communities of interest and, finally, look at the remaining population of the northern Lower Peninsula to join with the Upper Peninsula for Michigans 13th Congressional districts.  To the degree possible, State Senate and State House of representative districts should match up with the 13 congressional district boundaries.  STATE SENATE DISTRICT—WESTERN WAYNE COUNTY For State senate district, a logical, compact  “Community of Interest” is likely the Western Wayne region, including Livonia, Redford Township, Westland, Wayne and other nearby communities to the south, to reach the estimated population of 291,340 residents.  STATE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES—LIVONIA With an estimated population slightly in recess of 94,000, all or nearly all, of Livonia should be formed into one State Representative district.  What a challenging task! I commend the MICRD members for their conscientious effort to resolve this complex challenge in a fair, equitable manner.

1067,written,,,Neutral Redistricting,"I hope the non-partisan commission will draw the new districts in a way that shows contiguous and cohesive geographic units within and along municipal, city and county boundaries. The idea is to avoid the oddly shaped districts that served partisan purposes or clustered people sociographically. Contiguous, cohesive districts within and along geographic boundaries will emphasize community and encourage representation of diverse interests within communities. "
1068,written,,,Appropriate Democratic Representation,"Please ensure the boundaries more fully reflect the democratic breakdown of our states electorate.  Since 2010, our states elected politicians have been wholly overrepresented by the minority of right wing populous.  This has to change for the good of our state and our country. Minority rule is a recipe for disaster as we have seen by the contentious fervor sweeping our nation.  Former President Trump was elected by the people in 2016, which provided a great example of democratically elected leaders winning elections in the electoral college system.  If the Democrats had not rigged the primary, Bernie Sanders would have won the nomination and most likely won the Presidency, but the super delegate system rigged the primary and Hillary Clinton won by courting the wealth donors, which was very undemocratic and cost the United States greatly with the election of Donald Trump, an individual wholly incompetent to lead this nation. And now that Pandora's box has been open, we cannot just shut it and continue living under the constitution and rule of law, as we have done since at least the civil war.  Truth is now under attack and sadly has to be defended because the greed of one man.   Our elected representatives should more fully reflect the breakdown of the populous with a slight majority favoring the Democrats at both the state and national level.  It is amazing we have a balanced representation in the House of Representatives considering the district maps the Republicans drew in 2010.  The representative of my District, Tim Walberg, should never again win an election, but based on such a ridiculous map he continues to beat much better candidates.  Please ensure the district surrounding Jackson does not stretch from Coldwater to Saline.  Absolutely ridiculous!  "
1069,written,,,District Planning,"First, I would like to thank all the commissioners for their dedication to this endeavor.  What a huge task you have undertaken.  Having recently attended a meeting of the MICRC, I have a concern about this “community of interest” designation.  Although many of the attendees who spoke made significant comments regarding the importance of protecting the interests of communities in general, there was a particular group of attendees who seem to believe that “community of interest” applies to the desires of their ethnic group rather than the community at large.  I certainly hope that we will not be trading political gerrymandering for demands of ethnic, religious, or other special interest groups.  Communities are diverse and all citizens should be given equal consideration.  Respectfully, "
1070,written,,macomb,Macomb County Manufacturing,"Good evening Commission, my name is Fred Nienstedt, I've spent most of my life in Macomb County. I work in Warren. I work in manufacturing. I am a skilled tradesman. I learned my trade from men who worked in Macomb County; who lived in Warren.    Warren is the heart of manufacturing for Macomb County. Most people who live and work in Macomb County know that the suburban communities north of Clinton Township is where most people commute to work, from North to South.    Macomb County is currently divided with it's congressional district. Parts of Southern Macomb County suffer because they don't get the same representation as the people who live and work all in Macomb County. The sprawling 9th Congressional District should be considered to be redrawn to so that more of Macomb County encompasses of the 9th or whatever number it will attain.     Communities of interest is sort of a term not well defined maybe. But the  gerrymandering is certainly self-interest, so that is what it is not. How many can we represent in one County? It is a diverse County. There is many communities. But the manufacturing is the base, it is the growth and in the southern part we see some of the aging now. To separate Warren out of the district would be a major problem for Warren.      We are making great strides to support all of the County with the County Commissioners. I hope that the tax base will support all of the County during the next ten years. Thank-you."
1071,written,,,Washtenaw and Jackson Counties,"Dear Commission:  I live in western Washtenaw County and would like to see the Commission reflect our true Communities of Interest (COI) and my confidence that my district’s configuration should run east-west rather than the current north-south configuration – ie, Livingston County is now part of my district yet I know of no one who has a connection to Livingston County, other than driving through on the way to an Up North vacation. I don’t have the technical skills to draw a “sample map” but I can describe a district that feels right to me:  Parts of Washtenaw County (including Manchester, Chelsea, Dexter, and Saline), plus all of Jackson County. Note: Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti seem a more likely fit with urban counties to their east.  Several intersecting connections create the COI in my recommended map area, including:  *Commerce – The I-94 corridor is a highly used connector for our residents who regularly travel east/west to and from Ann Arbor and Jackson for work, retail, recreation, and entertainment. Many are employed at the University of Michigan or at healthcare systems in Jackson or Ann Arbor, but they return home each day to our small to mid-sized cities and rural homes. We value work and we work hard.  *Recreation – We are surrounded by beautiful farmland, preserves, parks, and trails, and our residents have a deep reverence for these sites. We have gone hiking, camping, swimming, fishing, boating, biking, and hunting since childhood and have taught our children to appreciate the same. We unite around valuing and protecting our land, recreational areas and waterways; not just for ourselves, but for future generations. We care about outside threats to these sites; about clean water and safe wells; and about protecting healthy lakes, rivers, and streams.  *Broadband Deficits – While we may have good Broadband service in our small to mid-sized cities, COVID exposed significant Broadband inadequacies in the immediate surrounding areas that impact our entire COI and especially, our rural areas. Many of our residents (adults and children) have insufficient Broadband infrastructure, service, and accessibility. Doctors, hospitals, schools, and businesses discovered during COVID that many of their students, employees, and patients were at a distinct disadvantage for: 1) Accessing telehealth solutions; 2) Participating in virtual learning (K-12 and college); 3) Working from home; 4) Starting or running a business and, 5) Adequately competing for employment opportunities.   For these COI reasons, I’m asking the Commission to consider creating a compact district in my area that includes parts of Washtenaw County (including Manchester, Chelsea, Dexter, and Saline) and all of Jackson County.  https://www2.dnr.state.mi.us/parksandtrails/Details.aspx?type=SPRK&id=506 https://www.washtenaw.org/334/Border-to-Border-Trail https://www.washtenaw.org/336/Nature-Preserves https://www.haehnlesanctuary.org/ https://www.riverraisin.org/watershed-facts https://www.hrwc.org/our-watershed/ https://www.great-mi.org/watershed https://ruralinnovation.us/blog/how-broadband-inequality-complicates-covid-19-school-closures-in-rural-areas/ http://www.mbcoop.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Community-Broadband-Access-Framework-Compiled-073118.pdf https://www.washtenaw.org/DocumentCenter/View/11048/Washtenaw-BoC-Broadband-Committee-Report-FINAL-Compiled https://www.fcc.gov/about-fcc/fcc-initiatives/homework-gap-and-connectivity-divide "
1072,written,,,A competitive NW Michigan district,"Dear Commission,  Thank you for your time and efforts.  I am very optimistic that your work will result in representation that is more accountable to the voters and more accurately reflects their wants and needs.  Currently, Traverse City, despite being the largest and most economically important city in the northern lower peninsula, has representation that is not responsive to the wishes of the voters.  Traverse City is in northern Grand Traverse County and southeast Leelanau County.  Northern Grand Traverse County has much more in common with Leelanau County than with southern Grand Traverse County.  These similarities include heavy dependence on tourism including winery based tourism, an affordable housing crisis, agriculture revolving around fruit production, and prioritization of clean water for both economic development and quality of life.  As a result, northern Grand Traverse County and Leelanau County combine to form a community of interest.  This combination would also produce a district that is highly competitive.  Therefore, the representative of such a district would be motivated to respond to the wants and needs of its people.    For these reasons, I encourage you to form a state house district comprised of northern Grand Traverse and Leelanau Counties.  Sincerely, Fred Cepela  "
1073,written,,,An idea for a new and fair plan,"My name is James Thrall. I spent 41 years in the Field of Education - a coach, high school teacher, and principal plus 27 years as a school superintendent. I also served as an adjunct professor at GVSU. During my time as a superintendent I also served as a Local Rotary President and the Assistant Governor for the International Rotary for  Southwest Michigan. During my tenure I witnessed how school districts suffered financially because the district lines were drawn up for monetary reasons. I want to thank you for finally drawing up a new and fair voting districts based on the 7 criteria you have listed  rather than boundaries drawn for political aspirations. Given your criteria concerning population equality, geographical contiguousness, city boundaries and communities of interest I have a recommendation. The first house I bought was in Wyoming Michigan. I now live in Grandville Michigan. The congregation of my church is made up of individuals of both these cities. Children living in Wyoming attend Grandville schools. Children in Grandville attend Wyoming schools. Members of the service clubs and local organizations come from both cities. Rivertown Mall, a large shopping mall, is located near the boundary line for both cities. Both communities work together on many services.  My recommendation is this - seeing that both are so close to the criteria you listed and the fact that their population together meets the criteria for a voting district  - these two cities become one voting district. One other concern - Kent County has the population criteria for 7 districts. There should be no need to cross county lines for voting districts. The County already shares many services (Kent Intermediate School District, Sheriff, Library, etc.) and it seems logical  to keep their voting districts contiguous with the county borders.  Again THANK YOU for your time and effort in this momentous task. Thank you for listening and I will keep you in my prayers because you may need  them.   "
1074,written,,"warren,macomb county",Competitive Districts and new maps,"Good evening Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission,  I am Joel Rutherford; a 15-year resident of Warren MI and I would like to welcome you to Macomb County and the City of Warren. I know the task you have is a daunting one, so I applaud you for making the commitment to give us residents of Michigan new fair maps that will provide competitive districts throughout the state of Michigan. Since the word fair can be interpreted differently by different people, let me give you my perspective on that when it comes to redistricting. Warren is the 3rd largest city in Michigan, yet it has no city elected officials that are Black, Indigenous or other people of color. Now I understand your task is at the state and Congressional level, not the granular work of a municipality, but your work will certainly make a difference in the perception of fair representation for all residents of Macomb County. There are strong communities of interest between cities in Macomb that tend to run along a north-south line, such as Warren and Sterling Heights and other municipalities. Which will certainly matter in state house and senate seats of representation. When it comes to congressional seats, the communities of interest are quite varied, but I would ask the commission to please keep in mind that if the 8-mile road dividing line is broken, please do not subjugate the people in the southern part of Macomb County to a dominance by Detroit voters that will limit the voice of Macomb County residents living south of I-696. Of course, if a Macomb County only congressional district is drawn, please start at 8-mile road and work north until the number of residents is reached as needed, to keep communities of interest that have so much in common together, to again, ensure fair representation for all. This is not to ignore my brothers and sisters north of M-59, but to ensure fair and equitable representation for most communities of color. Thank you for your time. "
1075,written,,,Keep it Simple,"The following is basically my comments as made at the Warren meeting on Jun 24, with added comments based on the other testimony given at the Warren meeting  Hello, my name is Ron Singer and I live near here in Warren.   I’ll try to make this as simple as possible.	  I understand that you have to balance population in each of the districts but my request or suggestion would be to make preserving county lines your first priority.   People choose where to live for many different reasons and some of those reasons include deciding to live in a high tax county or a low tax county or choosing a rural county or an urban county.   It would be possible for you to take a small hi-density urban area and connect it with a large rural area to make a single district but I would suggest that the city folk who live there would like to select representation by a city dweller while the rural residents would prefer representation by one of their neighbors. Any single representative would be unable to best represent these two different population groups.   As your second priority, I would suggest that you try not to cross any city or township boundaries. Again, this is for much the same reason. People choose what community they wish to live in, and given the option, they will normally choose representation by like minded individuals. To the degree that you can keep communities together you can allow the citizens to have the best opportunity for representation by individuals that share their values and preferences and neighborhoods.  Thank you.  However, after listening to the other commenters, I’d like to add a few thoughts.  In the past, when the political parties were drawing the district borders, whichever party that had the chairmanship and the majority would attempt to design districts that would benefit their party at the expense of the other party. Gerrymandering is the practice of designing districts to give an advantage to a particular group or party. In 2018 when the citizens of the state of Michigan voted to set up the independent commission, the plan was to put an end to gerrymandering. I hope this is your plan. Yesterday there were nearly 80 participants and most of them were citizens giving their opinion. As you might expect there was a variety of opinions in the group. But there was also an organized single purpose group that seemed to be at least 30 of the speakers. These people all wanted the same specific outcome of your work. They want a district that includes Hamtramck, a section of Detroit, and a section of Warren, Sterling Heights, and Troy between Dequindre and Ryan. Although it seemed like almost half of the participants supported this - remember that one of them even said that an organized minority is the majority - if you were to do such a thing, that would be the very gerrymandering that people wanted your commission to end. Please don’t just go from political party gerrymandering to independent commission gerrymandering. Thank you. "

1077,written,,,Observation,"I gave a comment to the commission yesterday (6/24/21) at the Warren Michigan meeting. I thank the commission for adding more meetings to your schedule. I would like to point out that a clear majority of Michigan voters approved of creating this process. They did it because they are tired of ""Spider or Snake"" shaped districts created by the party in power every ten years. The voters want districts that have clear compact boundaries. They did not vote to re-define the term ""communities of interest"". If you do that, your decision will be a political decision and that is contrary to the voters wishes. The interests of Americans are the communities in which they live, work, play and pay taxes. They want representation for their geographical area. We are either all Americans, or we are just members of a loud minority demanding political power. If you draw districts based on this new criteria, than this ""non political"" commission is more political than the previous system. My community of interest is Chesterfield Twp. in Macomb County. Thank You."
1078,written,,,Redistricting Concern,As a new Township Clerk just starting the process of my first election I already have three ballot styles for a small election.  The Township of Lawrence in Van Buren County has three school districts in it.  This August our township has a road millage on the ballot and two different school's millage proposals causing the need for the three ballots.  I just want the commission to be aware when drawing the district lines that many communities already are divided up this way and the more you separate communities the more complicated our election process will become.  There are many reasons not to cut our small communities up anymore but changing the state government district lines really could cause a lot of confusion for the election process but also for the general population.  Also the county clerks need time to prepare the new divisions within their county for ballots so don't extend deadlines any closer to next year's election process.

My grandmother immigrated from Hungary and spent 101 years out 103 in the City of Flint. The City has it's ups and downs over the years and we need strong representation in Lansing. The people of Flint and Genesee County are often overlooked by the State. I implore the commission to keep Flint intact as much as possible when it comes to our state house representation.  Thank you for your time.
1080,written,,"flint,genesee,livingston",Comment in Regards to Redistricting,"My name is Sam Muma and I am a lifelong resident of Genesee County. I grew up in the City of Flint and currently reside in Flushing. I supported this commission at the ballot box in 2018 and I glad to see that it was overwhelmingly supported throughout the state. When I think of redistricting, I think about the party in charge. Both parties have gerrymandered this state beyond exhaustion. I would ask that the commission keep the City of Flint as compact as possible when it comes to drawing state house districts. The city has been through so much trauma in recent years that we need strong representation in Lansing. Please do not chop up Flint for political gain or to reach a certain number. Again, keep it as compact as possible. On the other hand, I'd like the commission to look at the diversity of our communities in Genesee County. Southern Genesee County has more in common with Livingston County in regards to school districts and agriculture.  I would like to ask the commission to consider linking southern Genesee and Livingston Counties together in a State Senate district. Thank you for taking on this task."
1081,written,,,Prison Gerrymandering 6/24 comments,"This is what I shared with the commission during June 24 meeting as public comment.  The United States has 5% of the worlds population but 20% of the worlds prison population.  The number of people in prison are disproportionately black.  In Michigan 46% of incarcerated people are black, even though black people make up only 14% of our population.  28% of people incarcerated in Michigan lived in Wayne county prior to incarceration, but less than 1% of the prison population is incarcerated in Wayne County.  Under Michigan's present prison gerrymandering system, people are counted as residents of their prisons for the purpose of redistricting.  They are  “represented” by officials who have no ties to them, their communities, or their interests, and who they cannot vote for.  It does not need to be this way.  11 other states count incarcerated people in the location of their last address prior to confinement.  Ending prison gerrymandering will be low-cost and easy for the Commission.   I have been told the Commission’s retained redistricting technical consultants have stated they have the ability to aid the Commission in correcting for the prison distortions in the U.S. Census Bureau’s census data.     Today, the Commission has an opportunity to interrupt the cycle of disempowerment that has been ongoing and ensure that our whole communities—including our incarcerated friends, family, and neighbors—are represented in Michigan’s democracy moving forward.  Please correct this injustice now, so that the skewed population counts are not in place for the next 10 years.  "

I propose joining Battle Creek and Lansing together in a Senate District. This would make the seat more competitive and allow for more minority input into our elections. Lansing and Battle Creek are connected by 1-69 and many of the region's employers (Sparrow, GM, Kellogg) are tied together by the employees who work for those companies. Please consider drawing a map that would put Battle Creek and Lansing in 1 Senate District. Thank you."

These communities have far more in common with each other than the rural areas of Clinton and Eaton counties.  I would ask that you keep Greater Lansing together. This will allow for real, fair, and competitive maps to be drawn."
1084,written,,,Leelanau County and Traverse City,"Members of the Michigan Redistricting Commission: I live in Leelanau Count, a peninsula that adjoins only two other counties, Grand Traverse and Benzie Counties.  I was one of the many volunteers who worked for Voters Not Politicians in gathering signatures for the citizens’ initiative that led to the formation of your Commission. I want to thank all of you who stepped forward to serve the voters of our state by establishing new state legislative districts. To this end, I urge you to reject any effort to simply modify the current gerrymandered district boundaries and to establish entirely new districts without regard to political composition.    A small part of Leelanau County is already within the city limits of Traverse City.   Our county has changed over the last ten years as most new residents are retirees seeking new lives “Up North”.   I believe the average age of our population is now the oldest in the state.  Like many others, my wife and I go to Traverse City once or twice a week to receive medical treatment at Traverse City’s Munson Medical Center, to shop at the “big box” stores, to dine at many of Traverse City’s fine restaurants, and to enjoy the many cultural benefits that are only available to us in Traverse City, such as the State Theater, the Traverse City Film Festival, the Writers’ Series, the International Affairs Forum and the Cherry Festival.  We also rely on the Cherry Capital Airport, located within Traverse City’s boundaries, which is jointly owned by Leelanau and Grand Traverse Counties.  Although we read the Leelanau Enterprise, a weekly newspaper, we get most of our daily news from the Traverse City Record-Eagle and the local television and radio stations, all of which are based in Traverse City.  We believe the elderly population of Leelanau County has so much in common with Traverse City, that the two should be considered one community of interest. Leelanau County is also heavily dependent on agriculture with many acres of our rural land devoted to production of cherries, apples, and wine grapes.  There are many wineries located in Leelanau County that sell most of their wine in Traverse City stores.  In this instance, most of Leelanau County’s farmers share this industry with farmers growing the same products on Traverse City’s Old Mission Peninsula and many tourists visit our area to take winery tours in both the Leelanau and the Old Mission Peninsulas.  As a result, the agricultural producers in both Leelanau County and Traverse City should be considered a community of interest.    Thank you very much for considering my comments. Jay S. Johnson, Empire, Michigan.    "
1085,written,,,Mixing of rural and urban areas must end,"I am writing to express my desire to see the commission develop maps that end the mixing of small amounts urban and suburban areas with large rural areas to dilute the impact of urban and suburban voters. I live in a rural area in Berrien County that has been combined with parts of more populated areas and has created a situation where the state and national office holders represent only the rural areas and the urban areas effectively have no representation at the state and national level. My hope is that the commission will start with the aim to keep all urban/suburban areas together and if they have to be split into more than one state or national congressional district that as little of the rural areas be included in those districts as possible. As someone who has lived in both urban and rural areas I can testify to the negative impact the lack of appropriate representation has on an area. While I realize the committee will not be able to make everyone happy by pursuing more compact districts, I believe more voters will feel better represented when a greater percent of the population is grouped together based on where they choose to live."
1086,written,,,Redistricting Concerns,"I am a resident of Shiawassee County and am very concerned about how you will be drawing lines for redistricting purposes.  I want to be sure that our ""Community of Interest"" remains intact and that long established local units of government are given the highest consideration when drawing the lines.  As you consider the 2021 apportionment for congressional districts, state senate districts, state house districts, and county commission districts, please consider using the following criteria:  1.	Communities of Interest:  Shiawassee county shares a common cultural and historical background with common economic interests.  It is primarily rural with agriculture, small businesses and businesses that are automotive manufacturing related.    2.	County, Township, City, Town or Village boundaries:  Keeping local units together should be a high priority.  The elected official in each district should be representing  the entire community, county, city, village or town if possible.  State representatives and senators often interact with local elected officials.  Splitting units of government forces those who serve in local offices to interact with multiple representatives who serve completely different Communities of Interest.  3.	Contiguity and Compactness:  Geographic continuity and compactness is also very important. Ignoring geographic lines would be very confusing for voters and difficult for elected officials to represent effectively.  To redistrict Shiawassee County in a way that would divide it up electorally would artificially divide a population and would be detrimental to us historically, culturally and economically.  I urge you to keep Shiawassee County as primarily its own Michigan House district and to keep it whole for purposes of creating a Michigan Senate District. For a US Congressional District, I urge that it be combined only with other counties of similar cultural, historical and economic interests.  Thank you for your service and for giving priority to my concerns."

As you consider the 2021 apportionment for congressional districts, state senate districts, state house districts, and county commission districts, please consider using the following criteria:  1.	Communities of Interest:  Shiawassee county shares a common cultural and historical background with common economic interests.  It is primarily rural with agriculture, small businesses and businesses that are automotive manufacturing related.    2.	County, Township, City, Town or Village boundaries:  Keeping local units together should be a high priority.  The elected official in each district should be representing  the entire community, county, city, village or town if possible.  State representatives and senators often interact with local elected officials.  Splitting units of government forces those who serve in local offices to interact with multiple representatives who serve completely different Communities of Interest.  3.	Contiguity and Compactness:  Geographic continuity and compactness is also very important. Ignoring geographic lines would be very confusing for voters and difficult for elected officials to represent effectively.  To redistrict Shiawassee County in a way that would divide it up electorally would artificially divide a population and would be detrimental to us historically, culturally and economically.  I urge you to keep Shiawassee County as primarily its own Michigan House district and to keep it whole for purposes of creating a Michigan Senate District. For a US Congressional District, I urge that it be combined only with other counties of similar cultural, historical and economic interests.  Thank you for your service and for giving priority to my concerns."
1088,written,,,My family's community of interest,"My family and I live in an agricultural community.  Our neighbors, my family, and I live the agricultural / country lifestyle. From raising livestock, working with our horses, farming as a business, or hunting in the spring and fall, everyone in my community has the same basic desire and we all share the same basic interests.  Our community stretches from village to village, across township lines and multiple counties in all directions of the compass.  I buy hay for my cows and horses from my neighbor down the road and a farm miles away.  My community drives tractors on the road in the spring and combines from field to field in the fall.  We even have a day designated at our school for “Drive Your Tractor to School”.  We work in the barn to all hours of the night.  We get calls from our neighbors early in the morning asking, did your cows get out?  Our community is diverse in people from all walks of life, rich with traditions and heritage, unified in a single purpose and that purpose is to live in the country.  I would encourage the committee to keep the rural communities of interest in mind when designating district lines for State Representative, State Senator, and US Representative."

1090,written,,"warren,sterling heights city,auto workers,arabamerican,chaldean,refugees,social work,sterling heights",Joining Warren & Sterling Heights ,"My name is Michael A. I’m a lifelong resident of Warren, and Sterling Heights. I wanted to write to express my support for having Warren and Sterling Heights in the same district, as they have extensive communal and demographic connection, as well as strong economic connection.  I was born and grew up in Warren, and as an early teen moved a few miles up the road to Sterling Heights.   I understand how important the task of this commission is. How it will have significant impacts on the people, and their representation.  I also understand that there are many people who are only interested in partisan interests. How to draw lines to best support their “group,” and how much more difficult that makes the task of the commission.  As I noted above, I spent my life in Warren and Sterling Heights.   I worked as an attorney, and as a social worker in both communities.   I can tell you that the most fair drawing of the district, the one that best reflects the “communities of interest” here, is a district (or districts) that incudes both Warren and Sterling Heights.  To illustrate, last year, I worked as a social worker placing refugees escaping war and violence. We specifically placed individuals belonging to several demographic groups through Warren and Sterling Heights specifically, because of the strong overlapping populations of these groups.  For example, we placed members of both the Arab and Chaldean community, (a community which I am a part of) in Warren and Sterling Heights almost exclusively, because of the strong shared community spanning between the two cities.  For minority and vulnerable populations to have adequate representation, they need to remain in the same district.  The communities are also connected economically. Many of my friends in Warren, working at the auto plants live in Sterling Heights and vice-verse. The Mound/Van-Dyke roads, spanning through Warren and Sterling Heights, include several auto-companies, with their workers (similarly situated), residing in both cities. To split up these communities would divide up a significant common community, and hurt representation through this state.  I appreciate the hard work of the commission, and appreciate you listening to my input and the input of this community  Thank you,   Michael A"

I am a life long resident (age 63) of this great state and I have lived in many communities all over the state. I have worked as an election worker pretty much wherever I lived and want to say at the outset that in every community where I worked on an election everything was handled properly and with care. We really do everything we can to follow the rules and get it right!  I have been following politics and elections since I was a kid. I have a vivid memory of election night 1968, Nixon v Humphrey. Mom let me stay up way past bedtime at age 10 because it was taking a while to call it. I knew she had voted for Humphrey so I must have been hoping he would pull it out! Then in 1976 my first Presidential Election that as an 18 year old I was able to vote!  I was a freshman in college and voted absentee from my home in Muskegon/Norton Shores. But wow that was a long night too, Ford v Carter.  This commission has the crazy awesome challenge of keeping the populations of districts as equal as possible as well as solid ethnic groups and neighborhoods together. All I can say is do your best to be fair.  I fear there is no way to make everyone happy.  Please try to make the maps make sense, and easy to explain to a voter. Good Luck, especially with the late Census  2020 data complicating the legal issues. Thank You and God Bless you all!  Dems, Republicans or Independents, I am praying for you all. Kevin "

My name is Gail Makos and  I live in Grosse Pointe City.  I am a lifelong resident (except for college years) and our parents and grown children continue to live here.  My husband owns a building business  in Grosse Pointe and remodels many historic  homes in Grosse Pointe and Macomb county. I am a Nurse Practitioner and work in Roseville. We have 3 generations whom have attended Grosse Pointe Schools.   I believe our community of interest is within Macomb county.  We live just 4 miles from the county line which is in Grosse Pointe.  When my children were young they played sports in Macomb county, and we continue to shop and dine in St Clair shores and north along the lakeshore. We currently are represented by candidates that  represent the City of Detroit many times they have very different ideas of what our community is, as it is incorporated into the City.  Over the years I have always  felt we have taxation without representation.  We continue to reside and financially support Wayne county but I believe we should  be included in the Macomb county district for representation  as  we have similar community's of interest.   Thank you for your hard work Gail Makos      "
1098,written,,,Encourage Dissent & Compromise ,"When looking to draw boundaries, consider drawing them in such a way that current political affiliation has no bearing. This may mean that a Republican stronghold now has more Democratic voters within its boundaries, and vice versa. This will help to stop the homogenization of thought . It will make candidates work harder to earn votes. It will make an elected official's constituent base more diverse. This  will encourage  bi partisan communication, compromise and healthy dissent.  We have the opportunity to move away from segregated thought communities and drive real change which benefits us all. "
1099,written,,,Inner ring suburbs communities ,"Charlotte Massey’s communities of interest  I have lived in Royal Oak since 1998, and the city and its surrounding communities make up my community of interest. I drew a map, which I will attach here.  The starting point for me is not a specific building, but the intersection of Interstate 75 and Interstate 696. These are the main arteries that connect  the communities where I spend most of my free time. I also get around on surface roads like  11 and 12 Mile Roads, Woodward, John R, Dequindre and Coolidge. My communities center in Royal Oak, but I shop and dine in Madison Heights, Ferndale  and Birmingham. I bike in Oak Park and northwest Detroit. I cross over a lot into Warren, Clawson,  Southfield and Troy.  My communities of interest are mostly middle and working class, with fairly modest homes, though they certainly have their wealthier parts. While Royal Oak is mostly white, Oak Park and Southfield are largely Black and Jewish, and Madison Heights and Troy have a big Asian population.  All the communities attract a younger and hipper crowd than some of the further outlying Detroit suburbs. Taken as a whole, these areas are diverse and welcoming of immigrants from different cultures and backgrounds.  Detroit’s inner ring suburbs centering on that 1-75/1-696 intersection are my home.  "
1100,written,,,Different concerns,"Michigan Redistricting Good evening. Thank you for listening to citizen input on the required redistricting. My name is Walter Kolodziej and I have lived in Grosse Pointe Park for 40 years. After the 2010 redistricting I have never felt my representative knew the concerns of the area I live in because of the footprint of the new district covers many communities of interest. For example, a person in Pontiac does not have shoreline erosion as a major concern. Flooding or falling lake levels mean little to their lives. A district composed of lakeshore and adjoining cities with a representative that lives in the area that would know of local issues and help solve them would be a plus. A local representative would also be available for town hall type meetings in the area for better citizen contact.   The current district resembles an oddly shaped creature and serves none of the inhabitants well, and the new district should be more compact and aligned with the needs of the occupants of the district.

I collected a few signatures for VNP and give a few dollars to them each month. Thank you very much for signing up and getting chosen to do this gargantuan, badly needed job! I commend you for doing so and appreciate your commitment. It's complicated, difficult, but so very worth it. Gerrymandering across Michigan has created a situation where 4 votes of one party are needed to overcome 1 vote of the other major party, and that has negatively impacted me, my family, friends and neighbors--for no matter how hard we work to get our candidate elected--it rarely happens.  That is supremely unfair and so we need completely new maps. My Community of Interest is Sterling Heights AND Warren, MI. In both cities I grocery shop, eat at restaurants, attend various events--Lenten Fish fries, Cultural Center events, I visit friends in both cities, walk in parks in both cities, etc. I'm in the Warren Consolidated School District, though I live in Sterling Hts. Our two cities share a major industrial corridor along Van Dyke and Mound roads, where workers come from both cities and beyond. We all take the I-696 freeway on occasion, sometimes daily. We share roads, religions, ethnicities, cultural centers, restaurants, stores, schools, etc. My State House map will provide a very balanced chance for elections; whereas now the Seat Share is 91% for one party. This must be rectified. Again, thank you very much for working to make significant changes and improvements."

I am grateful for elected officials and representatives who understand the needs of the farmers in this area.  It is important to me that the interests of the farmers continue to be in the minds of community leaders and held in high esteem.  I would not want the interest and needs of the farmers to be ignored or discounted, when creating new maps that could potentially downplay the requests and wishes of the farmers and other residents, who enjoy nature, wildlife, farmland, wetlands, forest areas, and the country side, in general, in these rural areas.

1103,written,,,Livingston County Plan,"Thank you for all the time and effort you are putting in for the important work on this commission.  I am from Genoa Township in Livingston County. Although I live in Genoa Township, I have a Brighton mailing address. I buy groceries in Brighton, use the library and post office in Brighton, fill my car with gas in Brighton, and attend many recreational events in Brighton such as the mill pond concerts. But I also go to the city of Howell for many things -- to the courthouse for meetings and to conduct business, to the Howell Melon Fest, the Howell Memorial Day parade, the Howell Balloon Fest, and to its many restaurants.  Brighton and Howell are the two biggest cities in our county and t hey face similar issues including infrastructure, budget challenges, policing, and so on. Grand River Avenue links the two cities and extends from Howell east to the Oakland County line. Nearly all the county's major employers are located along or just a few blocks off Grand River. Many restaurants, schools, health care facilities, libraries, stores, gas stations and more are clustered along Grand River. The people who live in the adjoining townships of Genoa, Hamburg, Green Oak, and Brighton rely on Grand River for services, employment, shopping, and more. About two-thirds of us work outside the county as we are an exurban area. We share the experiences of commuting on I-96 or U.S. 23. We deserve to have our common interests represented by one state representative rather than have our area split up.   The rest of the county is far more rural and has different issues. The townships of Conway, Cohoctah, Deerfield, Handy, Hartland, Howell, Iosco, Marion, Oceola, Putnam, Tyrone, and Unadilla are lightly populated and have less in common with the southeast portion of the county. I believe those townships could be grouped together, with Iosco and Unadilla pared with Ingham County since Stockbridge in Ingham County shares its school district with those two townships, as well as a newspaper and other commercial activity.  I hope you also will take your constitutional responsibilities seriously and draw entirely new lines rather than merely adjusting  the old ones . Relying on the old maps would build in the existing bias of the current gerrymandered system.  Also, please strive to create more districts that are competitive between the two parties so that lawmakers  have to compete for votes rather than be assured of victory in a safe district. Competition would encourage candidates to be less extreme in their behavior and proposals.  Thank you for this opportunity to comment. "

1105,written,,,Fair Redistricting is Critical  ,"Fair redistricting is absolutely critical if we are to maintain our democracy.  I noted that when there a statewide Special Election in Alabama a few years ago the winning candidate (Jones) with 51% of the statewide vote only carried one (1) of Alabama's seven (7) Congressional Districts (only 14%).  Closer to home in a recent year here in Michigan the Party that got only 45% of the statewide Congressional vote was able to win in 9 of Michigan's 14 Congressional Districts (65%).  A party which controls redistricting can maintain literally permanent majority control here in Michigan's Legislature by only getting at least 35-40% of the total statewide vote.  This is NOT true democracy and does not allow each vote to be equal to every other vote. For the sake of our democracy we need fair and nonpartisan redistricting!  The current 11th Congressional District here in Michigan, which resembles a snake curling through widely separate parts of Oakland and Wayne Counties is exactly what a Congressional District should NOT look like.    We need to maintain a fair number of majority African-American Congressional Districts (at least 2) .   This goal can be accomplished, as well as having truly fair redistricting, by making legislative and Congressional District lines be more compact and follow county, city, township and village lines as much as possible and by eliminating snake-like districts.  Thank you for listening and I also want to thank the Commission and wish them the best in performing their critically important work for our democracy."

1107,written,,"sterling heights city,macomb,warren",Keeping Sterling Heights with Warren,"       In summer of 2017, I moved to Sterling Heights from Chesterfield Township.   It’s been four years since, and I’ve seen much of what makes this area a unique community.   One of those noteworthy attributes I’d like to highlight with regards to redistricting is how the community here does not stop at the city limits – rather, it is organically interdependent with its neighbors, especially Warren.  	One thing I quickly learned after moving here is the Mound and Van Dyke corridors are home to a great amount of not just industrial traffic but also commercial interaction.   In fact, my friends’ favorite places to convene on the weekend are on these streets, and the exact city the establishments happen to fall into isn’t a factor for them.   My husband also works in Warren as do many people living in Sterling Heights.   Further, Warren residents come to Sterling Heights to use the pool at the community center.   People don’t simply turn around once they hit the 14 Mile line as the transition is seamless;   the communities are connected both in work and in play.   As such, this unity between Sterling Heights and Warren should be taken into consideration with redistricting.  	Another way to look at the interconnectedness of Sterling Heights and Warren is through their School Districts.     As a teacher in Troy Schools, I’m fairly aware of the nature of local districts. Warren Consolidated Schools, despite its name, services a large portion of students residing in Sterling Heights.     I’ve not heard of students, parents, or teachers splitting into different teams based-on which side of which street they live.    At a building in their district, just before COVID took hold, I applied to be part of the Warren Concert Band, and though I haven’t had a performance with them yet, the words “Sterling Heights” on my address don’t stop me or many others in Sterling Heights from participating with them.   Similarly, redistricting shouldn’t separate these connections among people when it comes to electing their state and federal officials.  	Thank you for your consideration. "

Macomb Township is a civil township located in Macomb, County.  People began settling in the area of Macomb Township by the early 1830’s.  Macomb Township is now on the cutting edge of urban growth with population in excess of 90,000. Macomb Township is located in the center of Macomb County. It is one of the fastest growing communities.  I have lived in this community for 4 years. Macomb Township has beautiful residential neighborhoods and wonderful parks.  Having 2 kids, I love that I have access to playgrounds so close to home.  Macomb Township also has a nature preserve that is a 38 acre parcel that is open for patrons to walk the trails 7 days a week.  It’s like being up north right in Macomb Township.  Macomb Township also has available to the community a rec center. They offer a lot of amendies and programs to the community. The Clinton Macomb Public library will be opening their new library in September.  It will offer three large and six small study rooms, a dedicated creative/story time room and quiet study rooms. We also have the 7th largest school district in the state of Michigan.  I am also the chapter chair for an organization called Moms for Liberty Macomb, County.

1109,written,,,Macatawa Park area,"My name is Lisa Jevens and I have a home in Macatawa Park. Macatawa Park is a very special community of several hundred historic cottages dating from the 1800’s on Lake Michigan, just south of the Holland, MI lighthouse. It is a beautiful peninsula that lies between Lake Michigan and Lake Macatawa. The Macatawa Park Cottagers’ Association (MPCA) is our volunteer homeowner association. Macatawa itself is not a town, but it does have a post office, a large marina and yacht club. The reason I am writing this testimony is because for decades, the Macatawa community (peninsula) has been split in half horizontally along an imaginary line that is an extension of 32nd Street in Holland, running east to west. Everything to the north of 32nd Street is in Ottawa County and Park Township. Everything to the south is in Allegan County and Laketown Township. What does this have to do with redistricting? Unfortunately, the lines for our Congressional Districts, State Senate Districts and State House Districts were also drawn to follow this imaginary line. So everyone in the north part of Macatawa is in the 2nd Congressional District, the 30th State Senate and 98th State House District. Everyone to the south is in the 6th Congressional District, the 26th State Senate and 80th State House District. We should be represented by ONE person in each legislative body, not two. Some of the issues we are facing are high water on both lakes and severe beach erosion. We had to spend a lot of money on revetment in 2020 and our beach access is still compromised. It makes it more difficult for our community to address this if we have to consult two Congressmen, two State Senators and two State Representatives. I believe Macatawa should be represented together as one,  joined with the beach communities to the south on Lake Michigan and to the east on Lake Macatawa. This is our community where we share the same interests, challenges and activities. 32nd Street (and its extension westward) should no longer be a dividing line. "

It is my observation that our current state house and state senate representatives do not represent the urban areas in our district, which comprise the bulk of the county’s population.  State house districts 64 and 65 are particularly unfair because both of these elected positions are filled by people from the rural communities that surround the more densely populated urban and suburban areas of the city of Jackson and Summit, Leoni, and Blackman Townships.  The greater area of Jackson needs representatives that understand their interests and concerns.  At this time, that is not the case.  House district 64, for example, includes seven rural townships, (total population of all seven is about 27,000), the city of Jackson, (approximately 32,000 residents), and the suburban township of Summit, (about 23,000 residents), where I live.  The residents of Summit Township and the city of Jackson have far more diverse populations and very different economic and cultural interests than do the residents of the small rural towns.  Our current representative identifies herself as a farmer and lives in rural Hanover Township.  She simply does not understand the needs of the urban and suburban residents in Jackson County.    House district 65, (in its current configuration) is representationally problematic as well and is non-compact.  It stretches and snakes around from N/W Lenawee County through eastern and northern Jackson County and then meanders down to Eaton County. As it is now, HD 65 has three rural townships, the city of Eaton Rapids and the suburban townships of Blackman and Leoni.  These communities are vastly different from each other both economically and culturally.    The rural areas and townships on the edges of the County (Waterloo, Henrietta, Rives, Tompkins, Springport, Parma, Sandstone, Concord, Spring Arbor, Pulaski, Hanover, Liberty, Columbia, Norvell, Napoleon, and Grass Lake) should be considered a Community of Interest due to shared characteristics of agriculture, natural resource conservation, wildlife management, lake living, country living, and concerns of internet access and healthcare access.   The urban and suburban areas, (including the city of Jackson and Blackman, Summit, and Leoni Townships) cannot be represented fairly and appropriately by a rural resident.   The City of Jackson shares more interests and needs with the nearby suburban townships of Blackman, Summit and Leoni and should have a representative who understands and supports their specific needs.  The City of Jackson, as well as Summit, Blackman, and Leoni townships share a major transportation crossroads.  Thousands of Jackson County residents frequently travel north to the Lansing area via U.S.127, and thousands more travel east to Chelsea, Dexter, and Ann Arbor via I-94 to get to shopping, healthcare, universities and colleges, and work.  My husband, for example, works in Ann Arbor and travels U.S.127 and I-94 five days a week.  The urban/suburban residents of the greater Jackson area share many cultural and economic characteristics that make them distinctly different from rural communities..  These urban/suburban areas, for instance, share water and sewer systems as well as police and fire services.  Many of the residents of the city of Jackson and the townships of Summit, Leoni, and Blackman live in neighborhoods and apartments, and do not identify significantly with the rural/small-town/farm nature of the surrounding rural townships.    Thank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts and concerns. I hope you will consider these ideas for drawing the state house district lines more fairly in Jackson County.  Thank you for doing this very important work.  Sandra Hofman-Kingston, Summit Township 309 Parkway St. Jackson, MI 49203  "
1113,written,,,Representation must be fair,"Our democracy will only stay strong and viable if our elected representatives truly reflect the state's population. It is not right and fair for districts to be drawn to ensure one party's success over the other party. Districts should be drawn in a logical geographical manner, without consideration as to the dominant political party in one area or the other.  The only consideration should be population counts within particular geographical regions. Expanding regions to ensure success for a particular party is anti-democratic. When decisions are made to ensure power rests in the hands of a particular party, we are no longer practicing democracy. Our state legislature should be an accurate reflection of the wishes of the population as a whole and it has not been for a long time."

US Congressional District 11 is ridiculous.  Troy has different interests and issues from the lakes area west of Pontiac and from the much newer suburbs with train traffic west of Detroit.  District 11 has little nooks, crannies and cutouts in its outline and was clearly designed without the needs of the voters in mind.  Troy has much more in common with Bloomfield Twp., Clawson, Berkley, Madison Heights and Royal Oak.  Even Pontiac makes more sense than Waterford, as part of this congressional district. State Senate district 13 is fine.  It is small and compact, and its voters are similar in their needs. State Congressional District 41 is fine.  Consisting mostly of two, similar, neighboring communities, Troy and Clawson, the voters are similar in their needs.  Thank you again for considering this request. Regards, Ruth Kell "

After many months of hard work on the elections, we flipped those seats to Democrats, Representative Mari Manoogian and Senator Rosemary Bayer. The same thing happened in the adjacent district of Senator Mallory McMorrow. This was despite the efforts of the Republicans drawing gerrymandered districts and trying to benefit themselves. Only recently have our communities of Birmingham and Bloomfield seen gains that need to continue to be recognized. We finally have representatives who are responsive to our concerns, highly visible, and available to their constituents.

My community of interest runs from the city of Algonac all the way up to the town of Lexington. And includes all the communities along the St. Clair River.  I believe it is the St. Clair River, the Pine River, Belle River,  the Black River and all the streams that flow from these water that creates the community for the individuals and families that live in St. Clair  County.    Every riverfront town has a riverfront park. Here is where individuals and families, young and old, retired or  working can spend time playing games, walking, picnicking, listening to concerts, or just sit and watch the boats go by. We are not a hustle bustle County, compared to Macomb County we are not a manufacturing base. Therefore, our values are different.  My  township of St. Clair even has horse farms. We prefer it that way. We also have bike trails, (no need to drive to a State park) throughout St. Clair County. Want fish for dinner, go down to the public shoreline and drop a line. Kayaking? We have that too.  The wages in St. Clair County are lower than those in Macomb County, but they have been for many years. A fair trade for a different lifestyle.

The political party in power may win more elections, but it's the voters who lose. The determination of fairly drawn districts should depend on the results of the census and commonsense, not the political whims of a political party.

1129,written,,,Macomb Only Congressional District,"Macomb County deserves to have its own congressional district.  We are a unique, blue collar county that shouldn't have our voice muddled by dividing us up. Currently the southern portion of the county is placed in a district that is largely controlled by the Oakland County portion of the district.  Similarly, the northern portion of the county has its voice drowned out by the farm country in the thumb and surrounding counties.    A Macomb County district comprised of Warren, Center Line, Eastpointe, Roseville, Fraser, St. Clair Shores, Clinton Township, Harrison Township, Mount Clemens, Sterling Heights, Shelby Township, and Macomb Township meets all of the elements required of the commission when forming congressional districts.    (a) Districts shall be of equal population as mandated by the United States constitution, and shall comply with the voting rights act and other federal laws.    This district would be comprised of roughly 1/13 of the population of the State of Michigan.  Adding a small portion of Chesterfield Township will solve any issue with the size of the district.  (b) Districts shall be geographically contiguous. Island areas are considered to be contiguous by land to the county of which they are a part.  This district would be continguous.    (c) Districts shall reflect the state's diverse population and communities of interest. Communities of interest may include, but shall not be limited to, populations that share cultural or historical characteristics or economic interests. Communities of interest do not include relationships with political parties, incumbents, or political candidates.  Macomb is a blue collar county.  We have several communities of interest that are currently broken up due to the split in congressional districts.  This includes our middle eastern populations in Warren and Sterling Heights; large African American populations in Warren, Eastpointe, Clinton Township, and Mount Clemens; business interests along the Mound Van Dyke Corridor; and Asian populations in Warren and Sterling Heights, among others.  The reality is that the only portion of Macomb County that is not in some way significantly similar to other portions of the county are the far norther farm communities which are far more similar to the thumb.  (d) Districts shall not provide a disproportionate advantage to any political party. A disproportionate advantage to a political party shall be determined using accepted measures of partisan fairness.  This district would be a 50/50 district and would be competitive every election.  (e) Districts shall not favor or disfavor an incumbent elected official or a candidate.  This district would be drawn based on the needs of the community, not the needs of any incumbent.  (f) Districts shall reflect consideration of county, city, and township boundaries.  This district is the best reflection of the county as it only takes out a small portion of the northern rural townships.    (g) Districts shall be reasonably compact.  This district would be compact."
1130,written,,,Please keep Washtenaw County WHOLE,"I’m a 71 y/o senior citizen who lives alone and has a small extended family nearby. I live in Chelsea, MI which is in western Washtenaw County. I enjoy living in my small town which has both a rural flavor, yet many of the cultural amenities of a larger city like Ann Arbor. I rarely shop or visit the city of Jackson but do travel through it via I-94 from time to time. I have little doubt I will end my days here.   I use I-94 on a weekly basis to shop, attend Church in Ann Arbor and visit friends. This interstate cuts through both Jackson and Washtenaw Counties. I have also used Amtrak many times and departed from both Jackson and Ann Arbor depots. I am not holding my breath, but an Amtrak stop in Chelsea would make my day! I typically receive any support services I might need (healthcare, government services like SOS, public health, etc.) from Washtenaw County, but not Jackson.  But our Chelsea school system does include both Jackson and Washtenaw counties. I will note that I previously lived in a home which was in the Waterloo Twp., Jackson Co, and Chelsea school district and we struggled with having NO broadband service because none of the internet service providers felt ‘there was a business case’ to make this available. This impacted my ability to work from home in so many ways! In fact, it’s one reason I eventually moved to the City of Chelsea. This also became very clear during the last 15 months when our school district had approximately 40% of the students trying to attend school virtually yet they had NO high-speed internet.   My community lacks much in the way of public transportation (i.e., we really don’t even have reliable Uber and Lyft!). Most of the folks I speak with work in the Ann Arbor area since that is where the jobs are (vs. going to Jackson).  Some go all the way to the Detroit area via I-94.  Our health services are primarily through St. Joe’s Hospital and U of M which have large medical centers and hospitals and affiliated physician offices in the Ann Arbor and surrounding areas (like Chelsea). I know of very few people who use the Henry Ford Health System which acquired Allegiance in Jackson.  Healthcare systems actually create a HUGE Community of Interest as I'm sure you are aware! A strong community support in Chelsea is the Chelsea Senior Center which has done an amazing job setting up a transportation option (the WAVE bus) within Chelsea and into the Ann Arbor area.  This is huge for those needing services in Ann Arbor.   I believe a change to the U.S. House district needs to include ALL of Washtenaw County. That way, there’s a better chance of getting Federal funding for public transit to include our small city, support services, broadband and other critical infrastructure so that people like me don’t have to age out of living in a small town yet can enjoy the amenities of a larger city like Ann Arbor or Ypsilanti.  And lastly, thank you ALL for doing this very important and challenging work to redraw out State’s district lines so they are fair and work for the people and not just the politicians. This is the ONLY way Democracy can work! Thank you so much! "
1131,written,,,Return Port Huron to St. Clair County,"Good evening, commissioners.  My name is Jim Frank, and I am chair of the St. Clair County Democratic Party. We are glad to have you hold this meeting in St. Clair County’s largest city and its county seat. We hope that the hard work and attention which you are paying to citizens around the state will result in fair maps, more competitive races, and better representation of voters throughout Michigan. Our party has supported and continues to support this initiative, then proposal, now amendment to the state constitution. The project is enormous and critical to preserve the concept that districts are drawn in such a way as not to silence a group of voters by breaking them up into many districts or concentrating them into a district, though those voters are widespread across a region within a number of districts. Cracking and packing districts does just that, and we look forward to your work, which will undo these undemocratic and unjust methods which have been employed here in eastern Michigan.  You might ask why I title this “Return Port Huron to St. Clair County.” When it comes to basic geography, you certainly are in Port Huron and St. Clair County. Port Huron is moreover the county seat, the largest city in the Thumb, and the location of the Board of Commissioners, the County Clerk, the County Courthouse, but sadly not the Sheriff’s Office. Nevertheless, all evidence points to the fact that the city is indeed in this county. However, if one examines the state house district that Port Huron belongs to, it is the 83rd. The 83rd district is comprised of Sanilac County, Port Huron, Fort Gratiot, and Burtchville. The city as part of the 83rd map has been removed from St. Clair County, which is in fact broken up into 3 districts. The county seat, Sandusky, of Sanilac County is obviously in the 83rd. What or whose interest does it serve to move the county seat of St. Clair County into a district made up almost entirely of Sanilac County. I think we know the answer. The only reason to draw the map as it is currently drawn is to sever the largest bloc of Democratic voters in St. Clair County and move them into am overwhelmingly red district dominated by Sanilac County. This type of map drawing is a classic example of cracking a district—breaking up a district in order to move a group of voters from one district to another thus diluting the effect of their vote. If one looks at how St. Clair County has been carved up for the 83rd, 81st, and 32nd, one can’t help but see the Republican caucus drew them to create safe state representative seats for the Republican party.   I encourage the this commission to restore Port Huron and its northern suburbs to a district that allows the citizens of Port Huron to vote with their fellow citizens of St. Clair County. It is the county seat after all, so it follows that it should be at the center of a district that is made up of mostly citizens of St. Clair County rather than another county. To separate the city from the county means the state representative is beholden to voters who do not confront the same issues or partake of particular interests specific to their location—the border crossing with Canada and attendant issues is one that is specific to Port Huron as an example. However, when the districts were drawn, it’s clear that securing safe districts for Republicans mattered more than reasonable grouping of citizens with shared interests and needs. The 83rd should be merged with other rural counties in the Thumb or stand alone as its own district.   Port Huron deserves to be returned to the 81st district, which is primarily made up of St. Clair County.   I’d like to thank the commission for allowing me to testify, and I wish you all best of luck in the coming months as you tackle redistricting."

1133,written,,,South Warren,"I am writing to describe a community of interest relationship between South Warren and Detroit.  South Warren is generally understood to be the Warren neighborhoods south of I-696 and north of Eight Mile Road.  The Eight Mile Road boundary between Detroit and Warren is also the boundary between Wayne County and Macomb County.  Today, that boundary has no bearing on the cultural, social, or economic ties that exist between the people who live in north Detroit and the people who live in south Warren.  They share a community of interest that should be reflected in the political districts that are drawn.  The people who advocate for the Eight Mile Road boundary to be respected will also advocate that Warren and Sterling Heights share a community of interest relationship.  One of the examples they will cite is the Warren Consolidated School district, which includes schools in both Warren and Sterling Heights but does not include all the schools in Warren, in spite of the district name.  The Fitzgerald Public School district lies almost entirely in South Warren.  Based on the most recent information I was able to find online, Warren Consolidated Schools is 67.8% white and 12.9% Black;  Fitzgerald Public Schools is 21.6% white and 49.8% Black.  These demographic differences imply social, cultural, and most importantly economic needs for the students in the Fitzgerald Public Schools that can best be represented by inclusion in a district that also includes other majority Black schools.  Even regular folks like us know that public money is more likely to go to a white majority school than to a black majority school.  The students in the Fitzgerald Public School district deserve representation in our legislatures that will fight for them.   I’m not sure that will happen if they are part of a district that includes  Sterling Heights.  Regarding the decision to not include the Fitzgerald Public School district in the Warren Consolidated School district, it could be argued that the Warren residents who made that decision sought to associate themselves with schools that have a majority white student population.  A quick search for districts that serve Sterling Heights shows there are several, all with admirable academics, desirable economic statistics and high home values.  And majority white student populations. "
1134,written,,, apportionment of Congressional district,I am deeply troubled by the tendency to Gerrymandering of our beautiful state of Michigan.  Clearly the guidelines have been ignored.  I am confident that the Michigan Redistricting Commission will consider factors such as reasonable size ( a member of Congress should be able to travel the district within a manageable time frame).  Issues of fairness regarding matters such as race and partisan composition should be considered. Preserving the existing political communities is desirable.  I fear that the Republicans no longer wish to win the minds and hearts of the American people.  Their goal is to eliminate our ability to vote in a manner that counts or even to eliminate our access to the ballot box completely.

1139,written,,,Communities of Interest,"I note the Commissions interest in comments related to Communities of Interest and read that was one of the principles you are called to consider.  I'd like to better understand why?  Is it our intent in an election to have representatives that only represent the views of a subset of their constituents?  That is what we have in District 10 now, and I would suggest the underlying principle behind gerrymandering.    Redistricting, that includes people that are mostly located in the same general physical area and easily understandable physical boundaries make a lot of sense to me.  For starters, it is easier for the representative to physically serve his or her constituents via an accessible office, and also helps people understand why the boundaries are where they are.  Having the State's population uniformly distributed across our elected representatives, also more uniformly distributes their workload.    Beyond that, it seems to me, it is better to have our representatives receive input from the type of diversity that exists across the state and not try to consolidate people that think alike and have the same interests in one district to create a majority.   That is a significant contributor to the partisanship that seems to be tearing our country apart and putting our democracy at risk.  It also leaves the minority, that may think differently, completely unrepresented.  That's currently my situation in District 10.    At first I thought maybe school districts should be communities of interest.  But the more I thought about it, the more convinced I became that our school districts are one more example of the problem.  The wealthy can afford a great education for their kids and schools in poorer districts remain underfunded.  I simply can't see any logic that supports working to keep communities or organizations represented as a single entity.  I would appreciate you sharing some logic that doesn't actually undermine our democracy.  (Yes, I know we are a Republic, but we are founded on democratic principles and are at great risk of losing them.  )  Thanks for serving on this Commission.  I pray that your work will help us address much of what is wrong with our current representative government, at least in this State.  "
1140,written,,,David’s thoughts on redistricting ,"I would suggest that the commission examine the current districts, maps and population totals without any names or party affiliations attached or otherwise revealed.  Only by examining redistricting information without the filter of partisanship will voters in future elections be able to have any confidence in our political process.  "
1141,written,,,Caution re: Communication Access,"My comment relates to my work with the League of Women Voters of the Flint Area. I have repeatedly heard from people, who reside in Oakland County, who feel they are in a communications black hole as it relates to some of their representation. Because Oakland County tends to get a majority of their news from Detroit area media and Genesee County tends to get their news from mid-Michigan media, these people report that their political-related coverage is not complete. Such a construct means that the minority  members of the district do not share similar access to news. I can only assume that this is an issue shared across regions throughout the state. For this reason, I would ask that the commission do their best to ensure district populations have fair and ready access to information, through traditional media sources, that relates to their representation. "
1142,written,,,Districts Should Be Equitable,"Districts should be drawn in a balanced and equitable manner to enable fair competition by all persons and parties. If those desiring to hold office must appeal to a majority of a reasonably balanced electorate, they will do so instead of merely pandering to ""the base"" if that base has a distinct majority within a district. This would increase the importance of being responsive to independent, unaffiliated voters and by extension at least offer the opportunity for more broadly responsive and less partisan government.  Actually accomplishing this will no doubt be a difficult task, but not an impossible one. The MICRC was created by a mandate directly from the electorate to remove partisanship from the redistricting process. And all resources available to the MICRC should be employed toward this end. This may produce a strange looking map, but that would be preferable to the highly partisan products of the past.   This isn't an art project. It's an exercise in good government in order to produce better and more responsible governance.  "
1143,written,,,Draw Fair Maps by unpacking districts,"We are so happy to welcome you here today. In 2018, 61% of Michigan voters passed the Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission Initiative. As you know your mission is to draw fair US congressional, and State legislative maps. This is something that hasn’t happened in our State for a very long time. I have been a resident of Huntington Woods for 37 years. As long as I can remember, I have always been represented by Democrats. While on the one hand that should make me happy, and it does since I’m a Democrat; I have also come to realize that my district has been packed along with other inner ring suburbs to cram as many Democrats as possible into as few districts as possible.  My understanding is that Michigan is fairly evenly split between Republicans and Democrats, with Democrats getting more votes statewide in 5 of the 10 elections since 2000, but we have been in the minority 8 times. This doesn’t make sense until you start to look at our gerrymandered partisan maps which Republican controlled legislatures have drawn for the better part of the last 20+ years. If we had fairly drawn maps many more of our districts would be competitive, which to me actually means that we, the voters, get to choose our politicians rather than politicians choosing their voters"

1145,written,,"salem township,washtenaw",Salem Township- A Gerrymandered District,"Salem Township is a small rural/residential community in the northeastern corner of Washtenaw County. It borders on Lyon, Northville, Plymouth, Superior, and Ann Arbor Townships and includes the Ann Arbor, South Lyon, Northville and Plymouth Canton school districts. We are in the 18th State Senate District comprising a large portion of Washtenaw County and represented by Jeff Irwin. We are in the 52nd State Congressional District , which includes the western and northern portions of Washtenaw County currently represented by Donna Lasinski. These districts reflect the mixed rural and residential nature of our community, which includes a long history of farming and light industrial activities alongside a growing, diverse population drawn from the surrounding communities looking for a more bucolic setting with easy access to good schools and the cultural opportunities offered by Ann Arbor, Plymouth and other cities. However, due to redistricting changes in the past, we are also in the the 7th US Congressional District that stretches from the eastern border of our township to Branch, Eaton, and Calhoun Counties. It is currently represented by Tim Walberg, whose primary office is in Jackson. He has never conducted a town hall in the eastern portion of the district. This district has been carefully constructed to include more rural areas and to carve out Lansing, Ann Arbor and points east. Our township is a sliver that extends east beyond the remainder of the district. While there are common interests with some of the rural activities in other parts of the district, our community is very different by virtue of its proximity  to Ann Arbor and southeastern Michigan. By inclusion in this district, we have lost our voice in the US House of Representatives. I recommend that the MICRC review the assignment of Salem Township and include it in a district that more accurately reflects its location and diverse community in southeastern Michigan."
1146,written,,,Midland Business Alliance Testimony,"I am submitting this testimony on behalf of the Midland Business Alliance (MBA). The MBA is a  combined economic development corporation and Chamber of Commerce located in Midland, representing over 3,000 businesses. I serve as Vice President of Advocacy for the MBA. Thank you for the opportunity to provide this written testimony.   In May, our Business Advocacy Council had the opportunity to meet virtually with your Vice Chair and get an overview of the Commission and your work. We appreciate the critical nature of this process for our state, and for the individual communities. With that in mind, I'd like to offer our perspective on a community of interest.  Many would assume that Midland County itself is a community of interest. The dam failure flood of May 2020 changed that, and created a much larger community of interest. Almost exactly one year ago, during the midst of a pandemic, two dams were breached, causing great destruction throughout Midland County and the surrounding communities.  How our community has come together to assist continues to be inspiring on a daily basis. Seeing cooperation and shared spirit of resilience emphasizes that a community of interest is Sanford, Coleman, Edenville, Bullock Creek, and the City of Midland. But beyond even those areas, we have seen collaboration with the community of Gladwin, in particular, and other, adjacent communities, as well. We are connected in our challenges, infrastructure, geography, and in that tougher-to-define way of helping one another, and daily showing what it means to be a true community of interest.  In closing, again, we urge your consideration of the communities immediately impacted by the dam failure flooding of May 2020 as a community of interest, as you continue in your critical work of developing new districts in the state of Michigan.   Thank you. "
1147,written,,,Reforming our Redistricting Process,"Hello, and my thanks to the MICRC for soliciting public comment on this vitally important issue.  I just wanted to briefly put in a comment and register my voice on this subject.  You don't need me to lecture you on the ludicrous nature of much of the districting Michigan officials have engaged in up to this point. Both parties have made a practice of engineering bizarre, nonsensically-shaped districts to boost their own political capital, and the people have spoken. That time is over.  What we need for you to do now is find ways to restore our redistricting process to an impartial, objectively-minded one, one with relatively simple geometric shapes, one where ""undesirable"" voters aren't shut out by craven political machinations, one where each Michigander has a fair shot at electing leaders that actually represent their interests. We need a process motivated by justice, fairness, and logic, not a process motivated by party-minded power brokers trying to consolidate and reinforce their ill-gotten gains.  I don't have a set in stone map to offer you. I just have the strength of these convictions, and I want to assure you there are many, many more people of a similar mindset who will not bother to contact this Commission because they have been disillusioned by generations of shameful skullduggery. It's your solemn duty to make that right. Please do so. Thank you."

People choose to live here because of that. Safe guarding the purity of Lake Superior's water is of paramount importance. This is also a college town that has regional medical facilities, shopping and tourist destinations which make it a very special place in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.  I don't think we need redistricting up unless your real intention is to make voting here a completely honest affair. I have never seen a MORE fraudulent election than the November 2021 Presidential Election and Michigan is highlighted as being one of the most corrupt players in that sham.  Corruption by election and other government officials is in the process of being made public by audit(s) taking place in Antrim County and in other states.  Citizens in the USA must have trust in their government at every level. I've also noticed the locations you have chosen for holding your hearings are in some of the most troubled (poorest and crime hit) cities in Michigan. If you do your job with transparency and integrity, re-districting will give these communities a greater voice in decisions made for and about them.   I want the  act of voting in Michigan to be absolutely clean and honest. Any re-districting you do must reflect that promise to the citizens of Michigan.  Do your best work. "

1151,written,,,Eastside community of interest,"Dear Commission:  I write to request the Grosse Pointes, Harper Woods, and St. Clair Shores be treated as a community of interest. I am a life-long East-sider. I was the GOP-Wayne 14 chair for 4 years (2013-2017), I served on Grosse Pointe Park City Council from 2005-2020, and I ran for State Representative in District 1 twice, once before gerrymandering and once after. I am on record opposing the lines drawn for these communities. In 2011, the Park City Council almost joined with all the Pointes to sue the State over splitting the communities into two house seats, but thought the effort futile and too costly. The fear then, which proved to true, was that the representatives would primarily represent Detroit and the Pointes interested would not be represented.  The gerrymandered seats also happened to be democratically safe seats. It had been a competitive district won by both parties in the years prior.    I have since moved to St. Clair Shores. All these eastside communities are united by our waterfront (Lake St. Clair). We face similar issues of high water/lake level, combined sewer overflows events that pollute our lake, and fish-flies. We are all suburban communities that face similar funding issues from the state for schools, roads, and general operations. Moreover, the Pointes, Harper Woods, and St. Clair Shores would be a competitive district. It would have racial and economic diversity yet share similar concerns in Lansing and Washington.  While these communities cross county borders, they are really one community. Folks from each city routinely go to the other for services, work, and entertainment. My children go to school in Grosse Pointe and are not the only ones that go back and forth. local non-profits serve all these communities. Shorewood Kiwanis for example is for St. Clair Shores and the Pointes.  Furthermore, the GP School System is in the Macomb Area Athletic Conference for athletic competition. We are one community and should be treated so in Lansing and DC.  Please consider the Grosse Pointes, Harper Woods, and St. Clair Shores as a unified community of interest in your map drawing. I'd be happy to provide more information upon request.  Truly,  Dan Grano "
1152,written,,,Very important points to consider,"Hello, I am a Resident of Washtenaw County and would like to make some very critical comments.   First, lets remember that according to the Michigan Constitution, these are criteria considered by the commission in order of priority 1) Voting rights act 2) continuity 3) Communities of interest 4) partisan fairness 5) Don't favor incumbents 6) City, township and county  7) Compact districts  I. I have noticed many speakers at the public hearings held by the MICRC wanting ""square"" districts. I am sure you have realized by now that this is very difficult task to fulfill when you have to keep communities of interest intact and keep overall partisan fairness in mind (criteria that are of more importance according to the constitution). I just want the commission to realize that ""square"" districts can also be gerrymanders just like ""uglier"" districts can accurately represent communities of interest and help maintain the partisan balance of the map. So don't get bogged down by how many corners each district has. Now, if you can get square districts AND get all of the other more prioritized criteria, then of course that's great!  II. Please try to ensure that the partisan balance of the map reflects the statewide margins. The 2016 Presidential race should result in a 7-6 congressional map, the state was won by 0.2% by the winning candidate and its important to ensure that overall balance reflects that. There are PLENTY of ways you can retain this 7-6 partisan balance (4th highest criteria) AND keep communities of interest (3rd highest criteria in the constitution). Try your best to ensure that Republican statewide wins result in more Republican won seats while Democratic statewide wins result in more Democratic won seats.   I know this isn't easy, but you can use metrics such as efficiency gap to see what maps ""waste votes"" for a particular party. Just PLEASE don't draw a congressional map that ends up being an 8-5 or 9-4 advantage when a candidate won statewide by by 0-3%. This is very important to ensuring the public's trust in your maps! Similarly, try to ensure that you draw 19 districts for each party for the State senate map and 55 districts for each party for the state house map when looking at the 2016 Presidential Election, which was basically a statewide tie!!   III. You will most likely be drawing two majority minority VRA districts that are grounded in Detroit for the congressional map. It's ideal you try to split Detroit into the east side and the west side since those are historically different communities. Since Detroit will only make up half of these districts, you will have the option to take these districts up into southern Macomb, into Oakland County suburbs (besides the city of Southfield/Oak Park which *definitely* need to be put in with West side of Detroit), or stay within Wayne County and take up the Downriver communities.   Just please ensure whatever path you choose, you keep that partisan fairness of the overall map in account! I recommend Downriver as a good fit for one of these VRA districts because if you look at the median income levels or education levels of Downriver versus a city like West Bloomfield or Farmington Hills in Oakland County, Downriver is much closer to Detroit as they are both blue collar communities. Detroit has priorities regarding economic interests or education that are more similar to Downriver than some of those wealthier burbs in Oakland County like Farmington and West Bloomfield. Again, yes Downriver and Detroit are racially different but they are united by relatively more similar economic interests. As long as you keep almost all of Downriver together, you can have a really nice district that puts ALL of East side of Detroit and ALL of downriver that hugs the Detroit River and create a majority minority district that satisfies the Voting Rights Act.   Your other option is southern Macomb with East side of Detroit, and in my opinion and extensive experience, it makes the rest of the map a lot more tricky to draw. But if it works out for you, just ensure the partisan fairness of the completed final product reflects our statewide margins. "

1154,written,,,U.S. Senate Districts are Needed,"There is a huge disfranchisement in Michigan’s representation in the United States Senate. As it is, one region of Michigan, greater Detroit, is represented by both of our U.S. Senators and the rest of Michigan is unrepresented.  This is the type of disparity that the Redistricting Commission was created to correct. To correct this, the Redistricting Commission needs to create two voting districts for Michigan's United States Senate seats.    With Michigan only having one district for both U.S. Senators, the majority party in Michigan, about 52% of the population, hold both senate seats and the minority party has no senate seats.  About 48% of Michigan’s voting population is not being represented in the U.S. Senate.  Creating two districts, one centered on the Macomb, Oakland and Wayne counties and the second district encompassing the rest of the state will allow all citizens in Michigan to have more equitable representation.  Looking at demographics and voting records, Macomb, Oakland and Wayne counties are primarily urban and vote democratic.  The northern portion of the mitten and the Upper Peninsula are primarily rural and vote republican.  The rest of the state is a mix.   Creating one district around the three counties and the rest of the state making up the second district is a fair, and equitable way to allow all Michigan residents to have a greater opportunity to have their views represented in the U.S. Senate. "
1155,written,,,Commission Needs Equitable Districts,"    What common bond creates your community’s shared identity? A history of African American and Southern migration to find employment in various manufacturing industries.  A history of an evolving rise of racial minorities in politics, religious practices, academia and other public affairs.  There is a history of economic advancement, sacrifice and political struggle as well.      What geographic area is covered by your community? Major parts include the CIty of Detroit, also including certain adjacent cities like Inkster, River Rouge, Redford, Westland, and more.  Most parts are urban in its layout, other sections are suburban.      How would keeping your community intact enhance the quality of your representation in the Michigan legislature or U.S. Congress? Keeping my community intact would help to ensure that districts with a high concentration of current poverty and a concentration of racial minority residents are centered as vulnerable and needing special attention in policy development and resources that normally go to affluent districts.      What governmental policies are important for your community? I live and work in Detroit, Michigan.  The policies that are important concern education, commerce, job-training, public transit.  What parts of your local economy are working or thriving?  What businesses and sectors are expanding and hiring?  Some of the moderate growth industries in the local region include medical office assistants, billing processors, retail sales, and truck driving.  There are also currently tax credits in the state of Michigan that involve trying to make Michigan into a major filmmaking region in the country.  What parts of your local economy are not working or thriving?  What businesses and sectors have been hit the hardest?  What are people struggling with the most?  The parts of Detroit’s economy which are not working mostly involve manufacturing.  This cannot be over-stressed.  Historically, Detroit has placed an inordinate amount of resources into assuming that the heavy-industrial manufacturing industry would be here forever.  There was a time in which various factory and heavy-industry-related jobs were plentiful for local residents, whether they were simply a high school graduate, or even a dropout.  At the risk of understatement, that era is over.  From the 1960s forward, there has been both drastic and gradual disinvestment, by both larger corporations and smaller businesses, which has economically crippled the city of Detroit and made the metropolitan area much less prosperous than in the past.   Manufacturing as an industry farmed jobs out to foreign countries while downsizing dramatically within our borders.  Today, even entry-level jobs at various companies require some form of formal skills training, a degree or certificate.  This prevents a high percentage of Detroit residents from even being considered for various jobs.  Thus, even so-called blue-collar jobs are not a sure thing for anyone unskilled seeking employment.  What are the opportunities of growth in your community?  What businesses and sectors seem poised to rebound?  What do you see as the jobs of the future?  Construction & Building Trades- With all of the blight and urban decay that exists throughout the city of Detroit, the various construction and building trades would be a prime industry to recruit urban Detroit residents for new jobs and start-up businesses.  General carpentry, electrical, plumbing, heating & cooling, welding, and various related fields are all growth industries.  Detroit’s skilled-trade unions should be partnering with Detroit city schools and training students in their respective disciplines, grooming them for future employment after graduation.  Green Industry- A wealth of green-industry jobs can be initiated in the city of Detroit.  Detroit can be a much ‘greener’ city than it is now.  Creating new uses for land in the city is an absolute must.  A recent Detroit News article identified agriculture as experiencing slight growth in the state of Michigan, despite the ongoing challenges of recession and unemployment.  There are those who feel that an urban environment and farming can’t coexist.  I disagree vehemently.  I feel that there should be a City Department of Agriculture Development that encourages both large-scale commercial farming as well as smaller neighborhood-based farming communes.  Schools in the city can also participate- especially with partnerships with state colleges and universities, they can have dedicated plots of land, where students can work on them for credit, especially during the spring and summer.  Detroit schools can emphasize earth-science curriculums, leading to career fields as forestry, agriculture, urban planning, botany, new energy, and more.  Age-appropriate green-industry jobs training for high school students, college students and non-student adults can be a long-term boost to the local economy.  What are the obstacles to job creation in your community?  What could make local businesses more likely to start hiring?  One of the major obstacles for job growth in the city of Detroit is education.  Detroit’s public schools need more emboldened support and to demand accountability from all school service systems, including parochial and charter schools.  Detroit adults need GED training and basic literacy re-training programs, to help the adult population achieve the baseline competency that competitive jobs require for candidates.  State colleges and universities should be ‘adopting’ Detroit city schools and managing them with specialized curriculums such as medical science, physics/engineering, information technology, accounting/finance, and more (with the understanding that upon graduation they would already have some transferable college credits.)  Detroit also faces a major problem for formerly incarcerated persons returning to the community.  A high number of Michigan inmates return to Detroit neighborhoods.  Typically, these individuals leave prison with no applicable job skills, no immediate prospects for employment and/or training, and with negative attitudes toward rehabilitation.  There needs to be more special attention paid to the formerly incarcerated.  These persons need access to the mainstream labor pool.  This can reduce the rates of recidivism drastically.  Some conditions for which local area businesses could start hiring include, but are not limited to:   Mass Transit:  The Southeast Michigan area suffers badly from a lack of a comprehensive mass transit system.  As many as one-third of adult Detroit city residents do not own their own vehicle.  Minors and the elderly are particularly challenged in this regard.  Local insurance rates for urban Detroiters are exorbitantly high, which prompts many individuals to simply not purchase insurance (which is required by the state).  Many currently available jobs in the general region are at least several miles (and beyond) from the Detroit city core.  For people either trying to find work or getting to work, reliable transportation is a genuine must.  Detroit must be able to compete with not only American cities like Seattle, Chicago, and New York but also London, Tokyo, Berlin, and Beijing.  Mass Public Transit not only reduces the greenhouse-gases that individually-owned vehicles make, but also enhances quality of life for residents of a community.  People can meet their family and career obligations more easily, and recreational opportunities expand.  There should be multiple light-rail lines throughout the city, especially on its major thoroughfares.  The city should be partnering with regional government and business entities to have next-generation buses and street-cars to serve throughout the neighborhoods.  24-hour availability for transit is also a must.  Detroit should have special consideration for the proposed initiatives for funding for high-speed rail development and stimulus funds for transit development.  Not only would a new mass transit system provide a sizable number of jobs specific to transit operation, but economic redevelopment, including small business development"

1162,written,,,Reapportioning incarcerated citizens ,"Good morning. My name is Charles Thomas. I was citizen #1 giving public comments on June 15th in Detroit. To complete my statement I would like to add that counting citizens who receive no representation in locations that they are housed but do not reside is much like the 3/5’s compromise that allowed for persons to be counted for the sake of federal tax dollars and political power when it comes to congressional seats, but otherwise did not count. It also incentivizes insuring that the prisons be fully or overly occupied around census time. There are currently 2 bills in the Michigan legislature that would address this issue if passed into law, but will not correct the count until 10 years from now at the next census. SoS has access to the information on where citizens who are incarcerated actually reside when not housed and if the commission has the power, it should correct this now. Maps that properly represent this community are not available but will be forthcoming. Thank you again. You have within your hands the power to make the US Constitution a reality in Michigan when it comes to the “one person, one vote” power principle. Let those who gain the most votes wield the most power as opposed to what exists now.  God’s speed."

I have lived in East Lansing for 21 years and have been very frustrated with the way that my community has been gerrymandered so that my voice and those of my neighbors are not represented. Lansing and East Lansing have their own needs and concerns but have been carved up into 3 districts. The Lansing area's towns and cities are inseparable as they are contiguous and people often work in one and live in another. For our voices to be heard and our needs to be represented, we would like the Lansing area to be in 1 district. Thank you so much for your public service."
1166,written,,,Community of Interests,"Segregation is an enemy of democracy.  That is my simple assertion.  Political communities of interest, when segregated, work against the positive forces of democracy because it creates communities that can't or won't interact with those who they claim little in common, but actually have everything in common.  Rural and urban communities depend on the same main concourses of infrastructure that tie us all together - highways, rail lines, airports and centers of commerce.  Neighborhoods and school district have been notoriously segregated and the assertion that they are COIs fail to address the true meaning of political communities of interest - and the history of neighborhood and schools being used to purposely segregate has been litigated repeatedly.  Now think of this: When I go shopping at the mall, Meijer's, Lowes, Costco, the movie theatre or visit commercial center with multiple local, regional and national chains, I meet the real community of interest and it is diverse.  I meet farmers, suburbanites, college students, professionals, laborers, people on public assistance, retired people and young families of all kinds.  We are all part of that community of interest. We need that place of commerce and those businesses to survive and thrive for all of our common benefit.  And they need us to hold the same level of concern for their survival and success.  We cross many contrived boundaries - school districts, neighborhoods, and various zoned areas to all meet there.  Are you using data that tracks who goes where to shop and be entertained, to go out to eat and to buy their supplies?  I ask, that as you assess communities of interest, you have a concern for the continuing thriving of our places of common community over the places where we seek refuge from them, because in those common areas, we find the strong historical roots of democratic representation.  Make sure that each district, whether it is for a state house seat, a state senate seat or the Congressional representative rebuild the strongest coming together of the diverse interests of the smaller so-called communities of self-interest into larger, stronger and more diverse meta-communities of interest that ensure the cultivation of democratic interaction.  Give our elected officials places to go where they meet all the types of citizens from their district - not just the ones like them.  That will lead to better, more informed representation among our elected officials.  Thank you for reading my comments.  "

It is essential that all votes for all areas count equally and fairly and that the maps be drawn based on these two criteria.  Maps must be created without political party goals - i.e., maps drawn to capture one party members over another to improve chances of winning an election.  POLITICIANS should NOT BE INVOLVED IN MAPPING FOR ELECTIONS.   "

1170,written,,,East English Village District,"Our community contains multiple major thoroughfares that contain many large businesses, small businesses, schools, parks, waterways, and industry. These community assets provide jobs, education and many shared interest venues that are not only vital but beloved to our community. Our core district is the East English Village Community. Our proposed District would tie together the interest of multiple communities of the lower East Side of Detroit making it a District to be modeled after for years to come. This proposed district provides strong community assets and institutions that will provide jobs, shopping, entertainment, casino’s major league sports events to include Indy Car Racing, to not only the residents of this community, but to the entire State of Michigan.  Those are the larger assets of the community.  The smaller but just as important assets are educational institutions to include Wayne County Community College Districts Eastern Campus, Several Detroit Public School Community District High Schools, Middle Schools, and Elementary Schools. The proposed East English Village district will have a strong residential base that includes low income, middle income, and upper middle income residential neighborhoods that would all benefit from corporations located in the district such as The Chrysler corporation which has two plants in the proposed district. Detroit City Airport, Detroit Water and Sewage Department, DTE Energy maintenance yards, Universal Logistics, Flex N Gate, and Dakkota Integrated Systems all of which are major supplies to the big 3 Auto companies also reside in the proposed East English Village District. Assets like these in our proposed contiguous yet compact district will provide a labor force for industry and jobs for the residents of our proposed district as well as the residents of the City of Detroit and State of Michigan.   For these reasons we the citizens and community members of East English Village submit this proposal for creating an new district with our proposed district.  "
1171,written,,,Michigan's 11th Congressional District,"Shame on me, but I never really looked at Michigan's 11th Congressional District before.   I do not know the history of how it got to be the shape that it is now, but I never realized that my representative not only represents Troy, where I live, but also cities such as Northville, Novi, Plymouth, and Wixom.  All wonderful cities, but not cities that I think about as being 'in my neighborhood'.  Novi, for example is +40 minutes away from my home.  Wouldn't it make more sense for my district to include Rochester Hills, Beverly Hills, Berkley, Royal Oak, or Sterling Heights.?  All of these cities less than 20 minutes from my home!  I believe I know why districts become like this, and I am not sure if it was done by well meaning Democrats or Republicans, and I really don't care.   Wouldn't it be easier for my elected representative to cover and represent a group of cities that geographically 'touch' each other?  I am hopeful that the Michigan Redistricting Commission will improve, if not eliminate, 'gerrymandered' districts such as Michigan's 11th Congressional District.  Looks like a great place to start!"
1172,written,,,Detroit East communities work together," I moved to East English Village in 2012.  Having lived in downtown Detroit for 16 years, I was wanting to find a solid neighborhood with large brick homes.  I was excited about all the beautiful, affordable, and well-built brick homes in East English Village.  Many of these homes with their unique characteristics were designed by their original owners.  This area was also home to many Police Officers, Firefighters, Doctors, Lawyers, and other professional people.  I viewed many homes in Cornerstone, Morningside, and Jefferson Chalmers finally choosing a brick home on Harvard in East English Village..  East English Village, Cornerstone, Morningside, and Jefferson Chalmers have all experienced some hard times.  Housing values dropped in the 1980's, and unemployment grew significantly during this time.  The decline was making it difficult for even residents to keep their homes.  Even people who had been in their homes for years were faced with foreclosures.  Cornerstone and Morningside suffered greatly with many foreclosures.   This caused many homes to become vacant and neglected.   East English Village managed to pull together and fair better.  East English has recently been voted two years in succession as the best neighborhood in Detroit.  East English Village, Cornerstone, Morningside, and Jefferson Chalmers all have very organized Block Clubs that provide valuable information to their residents.  East English Village, Cornerstone, and Morningside share many amenities.  The Historic Alger Theater is one of two unchanged neighborhood theaters still in Detroit.  The Alger is currently being revitalized by a determined group of our citizens make it fully operable once again.  The Cadieux Cafe offers live entertainment, attracting many patrons from all around.  The Jefferson Branch of the Detroit Public Library has recently been re-modeled and available for our use.   Our three neighborhoods:  East English Village, Cornerstone, and Morningside organized the MECCA Development Corporation to work together and help to provide resources for our young people.  A key issue because our children are our future.   With help from the City, East Warren/Cadieux Development and our three neighborhoods working together, a plan has been developed to revitalize our commercial business district along East Warren.  We now have a Farmer's Market on the East Warren Corridor.  Balduck Park has had some upgrades with more to come.  There are Community Gardens within our areas as well,  Our 5th Police Precinct also encompasses the Jefferson Chalmers Neighborhood.  The 4 neighborhoods make up the 5th Police Precinct, and we all work together to maintain safe and stable neighborhoods.  The 5th Precinct works closely with us to provide community support.  All 4 neighborhoods are provided with NPO's (Neighborhood Police Officers)  who handle their issues and complaints.  These Officers attend each neighborhood's Block Club Meeting to give updates and address the groups questions.  Our 5th Precinct Commander, Commander Ewing, holds Procedural Justice and Restorative Practice Community Meetings as well as Domestic Violence Summit Meetings with the Community to strength the relationships between the citizens and the police officers.  Our monthly 5th Precinct Community Meetings are attended by the residents of the 5th Precinct (East English Village, Cornerstone, Jefferson Chalmers, & Morningside) and the 5th Precinct Commander, Captain, and Officers.  We have an MEC Neighborhood Patrol which is an organized, dedicated group of citizens who drive the neighborhood streets watching for unusual or criminal activity.  We are provided with police radios to use while on patrol and can immediately connect with the precinct if necessary.   It is important to me to keep our neighborhoods as solid and stable as possible by working together.  I believe we all share the same concerns and issues.  It is paramount that we continue to work together from City, all along the riverfront and Eastward.  We have many shared issues.  There needs to be good schools for our children,  We need more accessible and reliable transportation, a key to our stability.  Our residents need fresh food markets, grocery stores, and shopping that's accessible to all.  In the past our neighborhoods have not been properly served.  Our neighborhoods have been split between 2 separate State House Districts which has made it difficult for us to work together on our like and common needs.  It is relevant that we need compact districts which can unite not divide us.  This would also make it easier for our representative to participate and understand how best to work for our communities needs.    "

1175,written,,,Chid Henry's Plan for Huron Co,"I have been a registered voter in Huron Co. for 17 years and remember when Huron Co. was in the same congressional district with it's Saginaw Bay neighbor to the west, Bay Co.  That combination made sense to me then, since both counties share the northern coastline of the Thumb.  In addition, Huron Co residents consume news from Bay City/Saginaw, specifically WNEM-TV 5, the Bay City Times, and WHNN Radio (96 FM).   And Huron Co residents enjoy the entertainment and shopping opportunities in Bay Co.   For the last 10 years, Huron Co. has been gerrymandered into the 10th District, whose population center is nearly 70-90 miles away. We don't listen to Detroit Metro radio, don't get regional TV coverage from Detroit, and certainly don't shop in Macomb Co. I applaud the Commission for taking on this important task of re-drawing fair and competitive districts and ask that you consider redrawing the district anchored by Bay Co. and including Huron Co. in that district.   We are more closely aligned there than with northern Macomb Co and St Clair Co to our south.  "
1176,written,,,Mary's Millington District Plan,"I live in the community of Millington. We are on the fringe of the thumb. The thumb area has many large farms and are quite agricultural.  Millington also has farms, but they are  much smaller. Many of the workers in our area work in Flint or Saginaw or many commute to the Detroit area for their jobs. Millington schools used to play schools in the thumb area, but we only play Caro now. I feel our town is more aligned with Vassar, Frankenmuth or Birch Run. That's where many of our community members shop for food and necessities. Therefore I would hope that when district lines are drawn, we will be in the Flint/Saginaw  district."

1180,written,,,Input on redistricting,"What is most important to me is that the district maps that have been created by many years of gerrymandering are undone.

Please make the new districts geographically sensible and sensitive to minority communities. Thank you."
1181,written,,,No Political Favorites,It goes without saying that the district lines should not and must not be purposefully drawn to maintain a political party advantage. Political districts should look more like a balloon and not have tentacles that reach out to capture  party members.  I understand and accept the fact that redistricting may unintentionally result is overwhelming number of one party.  I am concerned that using school districts as a basis redistricting could result in an undo benefit to school district or to the politician. I am also concerned about religious influence on the politician if religion is used as a basis for redistricting.  I would prefer redistricting be done geographically without regard to special interests of any group.  In the past districts wiggled around grabbing specific voters to insure a party would remain in power. It is time to draw lines on a map.

Because of the unique way the lines are drawn, the opportunity for candidates like myself actually lose the race before it started. Because Republicans know this, it has continued to be unfair and unequal for not only myself as a candidate but also for the people that either live in the district or right on the border line of this district . Furthermore, I speak on behalf of myself and those who are afraid to speak up, and others who will not speak, because they have no faith or trust in our Government. Do to this as a candidate who ran a very important, organized, grass-roots race, we were able to gather support from people who did not even know, their was a challenger. Yes, we walked the entire District 3-times and spent lots of Money, but to know surprise understanding I would not win, but not wanting to allow anyone to just walk in office, that does not have my best interest at Hand. As a Black Man running for office in white District, where most never thought a Black Man would win, made them very confused as I was told by some people. Why? Surprising that anyone else would run against my current Representative, again that is not for all the people in the District. Yes pure Racism, as other ism's have been used quietly by this community, but I believe in fairness across the board, and if you're going to win based on the color of your skin and not your public works, as others would say, it's a slap in the face to the entire community in  which we serve.  in closing, I Olu Jabari am asking that we we Re-Draw the line, making this equal not only for candidates but for the people who choose the best candidate for the Opportunity to represent them at the table. In all things let their Equal opportunity, not because who we are not, but because of who and what we can represent as a people-Please note that I am ready, and have been to put in the work, in an effort to help with the process for all interested parties.

Prisoners are Michigan residents like anyone else and, prior to incarceration, they belonged to their own communities. An inmate's community does NOT include the residents of their prison town. Prison towns are overwhelmingly white and rural. Conversely, the prison population overwhelmingly is made up of people who are neither white nor from rural areas. Counting prisoners as community members of their prison towns cannot continue if we care about having a representative system.   Thank you for your consideration. "
1185,written,,"monroe,wayne,lenawee,washtenaw",Monroe County,"Monroe County's State House districts currently divide the county into a north district and a south district. The county is actually much more aligned to east/west division. I-75 is a major commuter corridor to Detroit and Toledo, and areas along that are very different in character to the farming communities in the west half the county.  In particular, Monroe Township, City of Monroe, Frenchtown Charter Township, and Berlin Charter Township have significant number of commuters into the metro Detroit area. We work, shop and dine in areas to our north. This also applies to a lesser extent to Ash township. This group is the most important to keep together in Monroe County.  The border townships with Ohio have large spill-over from Toledo, especially Bedford and  Whiteford Townships.  Summerfield, Ida, Dundee, Raisinville, Exeter, London, and Milan Townships are all dominated by farming communities.  If drawing a State House size district, you should keep Monroe Twp, Monroe, Frenchtown, and Berlin together, expanding in this order as needed: Ash, Lasalle, Erie, Raisinville, Exeter.  For a State Senate size district, Monroe County should be included with areas north of it, in Wayne or Washtenaw Counties. If the county needs divided, the western townships could be grouped with Lenawee County.  For a US House size district, Monroe County should also be include with areas north of it, particularly along I-75 and US-24, and US-23 to a lesser extent. Most of Monroe County has few ties to the current 7th district."

I live in Peck, Michigan in Michigan’s tenth congressional district a traditionally Republican district. I’d like to thank the commission for their time here this evening.   Right now if you were to look at Michigan’s congressional districts they looks like a poorly designed jigsaw puzzle that is not competitive. Its color is mostly red with odd shapes.  I have the privilege of serving on Sanilac County’s Apportionment Commission. We adopted some basic guidelines (pursuant to MCL 46.404) that I think you should consider adopting. Those guidelines include:  1)	All districts shall be single-member districts and as nearly of equal population as is practice using the latest census date. 2)	All districts shall be contiguous. 3)	All districts shall be as compact and of nearly square shape as is practicable, depending on the geography of the area involved. 4)	No township or part thereof shall be combined with any city or part thereof for a single district unless such combination is needed to meet the population standard. **This also applies to townships, villages, and cities unless such combination is needed to meet the population standard.       5)	Districts shall not be drawn to affect partisan political advantage.  The suggestions above also help to simplify election ballots as well. I urge the commission to create a new, fresh, and competitive congressional map that makes sense. It should be easy to know what congressional district you’re in. Base it on population NOT politics and make it simple to understand.      Thank you for your time and consideration.

1189,written,,,The Greater Lansing Area,"To the Citizen’s Redistricting Commission  Thank you for your invaluable service.   Please consider putting the greater Lansing Area into a single Congressional District. We moved to East Lansing in 2005 and our experience with the highly Gerrymandered 8th district has been full of frustration and lack of representation of the views of my family and neighbors. In fact, Representatives Bishop and Rogers were nearly completely absent from view in Ingham County. Mr. Bishop never bothered to open a constituent services office in the greater Lansing Area. Our district was stacked and cracked to ensure that Republicans had little or no chance of losing. It took a highly unpopular and nearly absent Representative (Mr. Bishop) – and a remarkable public servant with CIA and bipartisan Executive Branch experience (Rep. Elissa Slotkin) – to narrowly defeat Mr. Bishop three years ago, and then win reelection in 2020. Rep. Slotkin’s success should not be viewed as a problem solved: the district is designed to strongly favor conservative Republicans.    I hope that you will agree that the current situation is unacceptable and unrepresentative: I urge you to redraw districts in Michigan in a science based and non-political way, and to make the greater Lansing area part of a district that reflects our demography, needs and aspiration. I make this request with some trepidation as I know that Rep. Slotkin is extraordinary and that we might lose her from the House should the 8th be redrawn. I look forward to watching your progress in bringing Michigan’s district lines back to a less politically oriented state. Thank you very much for your hard work.  "

A Ford MoCo salaried retiree, a registered, contributing democrat actively supporting the Michigan Redistricting Effort. so much TREASONOUS republican behavior and propaganda being so lawlessly splashed across the world's air waves have shaken my confidence in the American government to the core. I am one of those who was educated before the treasonous whites corrupted , twisted folded and mutilated an already woefully inadequate education system. these peckawoods had only recently ceased the barbaric practice of kidnapping children of color and literally beat the history and heritage out of these unfortunate souls . many committed suicide. from my studies, what happened to the Constitution written by the country's true Founding father's. Not the ones on Stone Mountain like jackass Joe manchin seems to think but the ones that crafted  the constitution based on common sense and democratic principles. Like government of by and for the people. politicians are forbidden to lie to their constituents . one person one vote. why hasn't Joe manchin been subjected to recall for not voting like his voters wanted him to? same for any elected offcial in the Republican Party and the idiot senator from AZ. the Republican Party or more appropriately call The Confederacy is much more preoccupied with it's own wretched existence than the existence of our country itself. they can't afford people being woke to the fact that this republican control of government is illegitimate so these traitors have gone to the extraordinary efforts to eliminate distort or white wash American history so that no one remembers that the Republican Party came to power through means that were treasonous, murderous, treacherous.I challenge any elected official in Washington D.C. to accurately recount any true accounts of the legislation enacted by the first continental congress. they won't have a clue due to republican or confederacy efforts to pervert, distort or destroy true American history. this is facilitated by democrats whom have suffered confederacy treachery and treason with the murder of Abe Lincoln and just want and end to the war are Liberal but they are white too so nobody spoke for people of color. I'm reminded of this when I hear Joe Biden say ""nope I'm not going to investigate the insurrection."" and the democratic speaker of the house say ""to investigate the insurrection is not a good idea"" and Moscow Mitch in the senate won't allow an investigation because no republican can afford to swear to tell the truth. The democrat selected to head DOJ is resisting the transparency that True American Patriots deserve. American government today has nothing to do with of the people by and for the people if it was their would be  pressure being applied to the traitor Moscow Mitch for his writing and passing more pro Russian legislation than anybody ever. it would be broadcast to the world that Moscow mitch is blocking police reform because racist white cops should not be held accountable for killing people of color at will. I'm seeing government failure here perpetrated by treasonous peckawoods of the anti-American Republican Party and promoted and condoned by democrats suffering from battered wives or Stockholm syndrome. between all these different shades of white folks you all have F**ked around and let these ignorant azz brain dead confederacy traitors go full circle and create the same footing here that existed when your true founding  fathers left Merry olde England and king George V. people of color should be warned that the white liberal left is just waking up to what black folks have known for the last half millennium racist white America and if nothing of substance occurs to change things despite all this hew and cry from liberal news, they are behaving as historically expected. it would seem that American politics has become a criminal enterprise. for answer to the question what do the people do when government has gone renegade , let us look to 1800 France for a one course of action. That Guillotine did a lot toward behavioral correction of the wrong minded as it pertained to the people, their well being and their human rights.

1191,written,,,State Senate District for Cass County,"First, I want to commend the work of the  ICRC. You have my full support as you work to create districts that are drawn without partisan consideration.  I am writing to talk about Cass County and communities of  interest, especially as it relates to the boundaries for the State Senate districts.   I am a long-time resident of Cass County and I want to say first of all that I am a strong supporter of this Commission, and I am optimistic that the Commission will draw lines that are fair and based on communities of interest and drawn in ways that do not show partiality to one party or another.   As a life-long educator, I want to talk about some of the educational connections that help to make Cass, Van Buren, and Berrien Counties a community of interest.  These same connections do not exist with St. Joseph County to our east.  Consequently, we in Cass County see our state senate district including Cass, Van Buren, and Berrien Counties rather than St. Joseph County. Years ago, I worked for Tri-County Head Start, a group that is still a strong force in the lives of young children and their families in Cass, Van Buren and Berrien counties. I worked for 35 years as a teacher and administrator at Southwestern Michigan College (SMC) in Dowagiac. Our students are predominantly from Cass, Berrien, and Van Buren Counties.  Cass County students also choose to attend Lake Michigan College (LMC) in Benton Harbor in Berrien County.  Cass County students don’t go east to Glen Oaks Community College in St. Joseph County.  In addition, SMC has a second campus in Niles as does LMC, reinforcing the connections between Berrien and Cass Counties. The K-12 schools in Cass County are also connected to SMC and LMC through early college programs, and Cass and Van Buren counties share the Van Buren Skills Center in Lawrence. Likewise, the Cass County Intermediate School Districts of Cass and Berrien Counties have collaborated on a variety of projects for their teachers and students.   Consequently, when state senate seats are drawn, I am asking that the long-standing connections that create a community of interest between Cass, Van Buren and Berrien Counties be considered.   "
1192,written,,,My thoughts,"I favor a plan that is blind to partisan factors and which uses Michigan's counties as its base. For instance, you might start in Monroe County and add adjacent counties until you reach 700,000 people or whatever the goal is. Just keep going from there, splitting counties only where necessary. Keep it simple. In fact, you might invite a 10th grade civics class to put the map together. Don't make it rocket science. Be apolitical. Be fair."

Rochester Hills, along with Rochester and Oakland Township, have many interlocal and tri-party agreements that cover a range of organizations including but not limited to Older Persons Commission Rochester Hills Public Library Many local trails Rochester Avon Recreation Authority And Rochester Area Youth Assistance  The Greater Rochester Chamber of Commerce covers and supports Rochester Hills, Rochester and Oakland Township businesses.   The Rochester Community Schools cover Rochester Hills, Rochester and Oakland Township and many other communities Our faith community is extensive.  And the three Catholic churches in Rochester Hills and Rochester are grouped together by the Archdiocese of Detroit to provide coordinated services to our communities. Even the US Post office only provides one mailing designation for Rochester, even with the several zip codes covering these 3 communities.  The Rochester Area is how we describe our home and our neighboring communities.  It is the place my family has called home for 34 years, due to its wonderful programs, services and common bonds. Rochester Hills is a wonderful diverse area working to support a great place to live, work and play for all. Please keep Rochester Hills as one community in when redistricting and keep us together with Rochester and Oakland Township.  Please recognize our share history and our vision for working together in support of our residents and businesses.  Thank you"

1195,written,,"eastpointe city,better change",Mary in SE Macomb," I  am Mary Hall-Rayford, political activist and community advocate, and I stand here to attest to the fact that in the interest of having every resident of Michigan represented fairly and equitably, in State Legislative positions and US Congress, the MICRC must adhere to good faith efforts in redistricting the State based upon the interest of the electorate and not the politicians, while at the same time, retaining focus on the Constitutional directives for fairness in elections.  To ensure free and fair elections in which the voters are choosing their politicians and not the other way, I encourage this commission to fulfill its duty to redistrict, accordingly, so that there is proportional representation of all residents and their common interests in the success of the State of Michigan. The electorate, should be able to choose their politicians based upon the politicians proven interests and abilities, in achieving, what the electorate wants to see achieved, not the politicians.  Thank you for the opportunity to express my thoughts and I pray you decide the mapping with wisdom and integrity, guiding every move. "
1196,written,,,Cindy’s White Lake,"It is crucial that we uphold our democracy by eliminating the extremely partisan gerrymandered districts in the state of Michigan!! We citizens, of every party, have made it known that it is not ok to draw district lines simply to benefit one political party-thereby muffling the voices of the majority!! We absolutely must work to make voting more fair and more equitable so that all voices are heard!!"
1197,written,,,Charles Ballard on redistricting,"I spoke briefly at the public session on Thursday, May 27, at the Lansing Center.  However, two minutes is not a very long time, and I am grateful for this opportunity to amplify on my remarks.         The Commission has been given seven criteria for drawing districts.  However, depending on the way in which the criteria are interpreted, it is possible that they may be in conflict with each other.  In particular, I am concerned that the criterion regarding ""communities of interest"" could lead to a great deal of mischief.   It is possible to define communities of interest in such a way as to justify almost any kind of district, including districts that are shaped in a very grotesque way.  Thus, I suggest that when the communities-of-interest criterion is in conflict with the criterion regarding compactness, the compactness criterion should be given precedence.  If the Commission were to produce districts with hooks and claws, like some of the existing districts, I would find them very suspicious, regardless of how they might be justified in terms of this or that community of interest.  Similarly, if the Commission were to produce districts that are long and skinny, I would be skeptical, regardless of how they are justified.          Of course, Michigan's Great Lakes coastlines are irregular, and this means that it will be impossible to avoid having some districts that are not compact.  However, once we get away from the lakeshores, I hope that most districts are square, or fairly close to square.  An obvious advantage of districts that are square or close to square is that they will not appear to have been gerrymandered.  By definition, a square district does not have any curlicues or hooks, and it is not long and skinny.  Many of our townships and counties are square, based on a tradition that goes all the way back to the Northwest Ordinance of 1787.  Indeed, if the Commission adheres fairly closely to the criterion that the districts shall reflect consideration of county, city, and township boundaries, it will be straightforward for many of the districts to be square, or nearly so.            Fortunately, at the Lansing Center on May 27, I did not hear many comments that would seem to support grotesquely shaped districts.  At that session, it seemed to me that the most frequent comment involved citizens from rural areas indicating that they did not want to be in a district that included urban areas.   I do not have any problem with maintaining some districts in the State House of Representatives that are primarily rural.  However, it will be very difficult for the Commission to avoid having some districts that are a mix of urban and rural areas, unless we resort to drawing districts that are grotesquely shaped.  It will be difficult to avoid this even with State House districts, and it will be even more difficult for State Senate districts.  For Congressional districts, it will simply be impossible to have all districts segregated on an urban/rural basis.         This brings me to my own ideas about communities of interest.  Each of us is connected to a host of communities.  I am part of the Michigan State University community, the All Saints Episcopal Church community, and many more.  However,  most of my conceptions of community are geographical.  I live in Meridian Township, which is in Ingham County, and I consider myself to be a part of the Greater Lansing / Mid-Michigan community.  Thus, I want to echo the comment of several people who spoke on May 27, to the effect that the Lansing metropolitan area should be kept together in a single congressional district.  When I say Lansing metropolitan area, I think in terms of the Census Bureau's definition, whereby the Lansing-East Lansing Metropolitan Statistical Area includes Ingham, Clinton, and Eaton counties.  Currently, our area is divided among three different congressional districts, with the obvious intention of favoring one political party.   I urge the Commission to draw a set of congressional district boundaries under which Ingham, Clinton, and Eaton counties are all part of the same district.  Of course, the total population of these three counties is only about two-thirds of the number of persons that each congressional district must have.  Thus, other areas will have to be included in this congressional district.  If we were also to include Jackson and Calhoun counties, we would have a district with about the required number of persons.  This district would not be quite square, but it would not be far from square, and it would respect existing political boundaries.           Thank you for taking the time to read my comments.  I am grateful to every member of the Commission, and to the Commission staff, for carrying out this important work on behalf of the people of Michigan."
1198,written,,,Keep Greater Lansing Together,"I am writing to ask the Commission to consider putting the Greater Lansing area into one congressional district. I have lived in East Lansing for 18 years and have been very frustrated with the way that my community has been gerrymandered so that my voice and those of my neighbors are not represented. Lansing  and East Lansing are historically left leaning. MSU, the car factories with their union presence, state government and the cities' urban character have made it that way. But we have been carved 3 ways attaching us to cities (such as Brighton and the western suburbs of Detroit) and to swathes of rural Michigan, in order to guarantee that we are represented by Republicans. We share an airport, a university, a community college, a baseball arena and team (the Lugnuts), state government, two hospitals, two shopping malls, a public health department, a mental health department, an Amtrak train station and museums. We are a major interstate highway hub. The two main cities, Lansing and East Lansing are inseparable. Its people often work in one and live in the other. (My husband was a pastor in Lansing and I worked as a Lactation Consultant at Sparrow Hospital in Lansing.) We shop, recreate and get medical help in both cities. Our friends live in either city. The community hosts thousands of students together, we sponsor refugees together, we worship together, we watch July 4th fireworks together, we enjoy each other's musical and art festivals. My husband's congregation came from every corner of the Greater Lansing community. For the first 15 years of our living in East Lansing it was very hard to find a Democratic candidate to even run for the US Congressional 8 seat.....it was considered unwinnable by a Democrat (even though East Lansing and Okemos are very blue cities). In 2018, Elisa Slotkin was finally able to break that barrier. It took a huge Democratic wave that year to sneak her into office. Other factors were her moderate credentials and armed forces background and the fact that her opponent, incumbent Rep. Mike Bishop, was SO unpopular. He had not even opened an office in the Lansing area....so confident was he that he could completely ignore that part of his district and still win.  Please do not let Elissa Slotkin's extraordinary success convince you that it is OK to pair a chunk of Greater Lansing with Brighton and Rochester (90 miles away) with whom we have nothing in common. According to the Cook Partisan Voting Index MI 8 is still a leaning Republican district. It will take a miracle for Rep Slotkin to hold on to that seat, if the district remains as currently drawn. I recognize what an incredibly difficult task you have ahead of you, as you try to figure out fair maps for Michigan, especially as we have lost a congressional district. But I hope that you will see that Greater Lansing deserves not to be carved up for partisan advantage, and that we would be so happy to finally have a representative that lives in and works in and knows and cares about our Central Michigan community and its unique interests. Thank you so much for your public service."
1199,written,,"bloomfield township,bloomfield hills city,birmingham city",Bloomfield Township Community of Interes,"I was invited by you to share information about my ""community of interest"" in terms of the redistricting effort currently underway.  First, I am concerned about the representation by the Commission that it is ""constitutionally required"" to consider ""communities of interest"" as a factor it must consider in drawing district lines.  I have studied election law, both in law school and throughout my almost 30 years of private practice, and that representation is an incorrect statement.  That aside, however, I think the only appropriate way for Bloomfield Township to be considered part of a community of interest would be to couple it with Bloomfield Hills and Birmingham, given the shared boundaries, as well as the interchangeability of residents and businesses within that segment of the Michigan population."
1200,written,,,Thanks for the good work,"As I said at the public hearing in Kalamazoo a few weeks back, I'm very proud of Michigan for taking this course and condemn those who would see it undone, strictly for political reasons.

The Michigan Qpublican party has tried to undo your work and you can be sure we'll stand by your side until it's done."
1201,written,,,United we thrive,"My name is Barb Yagley and I live in Troy which is on the eastern border of Oakland County.   I believe that our political districts should unite us as a community rather that artificially divide us according to political leanings, racial or ethnic character, or any other artificial construct.  My community of interest includes my neighbors in Southeastern Oakland County and western Macomb county because this is where I spend most of my time.    Our community is very diverse; my neighbors come from many different countries, e.g., the neighbor across the street moved here from Pakistan, next door to her lives a couple whose family came from India.  My son’s friends who graduated with him from Troy schools came from both Taiwan and the Peoples Republic of China.     I am interested in compact political districts so that candidates of modest means can run for office,  our elected officials can consolidate their district offices (with corresponding savings) and so that our clerks are not unnecessarily burdened with multiple variants of ballots in order to comply with artificial constraints.  To the extent possible, each county should be within one federal congressional district.  Out of Michigan’s 83 counties, only three (Wayne, Oakland and Macomb) have populations in excess of 768000.    They are the only ones that need to be partitioned.  See attachment  To the extent possible, each State Senate and State House district should be within the county and each municipality should be assigned to only one State Senate and one State House district.  I highly recommend that you use the district maps from 2001 for the State legislative boundaries as a starting point. (Ref. Michigan Information Center October 2001).  Separately, I submitted a proposal for the 13 Congressional Districts which closely match the 2020 county populations as estimated by the US Census.  It did not take into account racial makeup or political leanings but focused on geographic considerations (based on my belief that neighbors will have similar interests overall irrespective of how they vote).

1202,written,,"waterford township,oakland county,pontiac city",Fair and Competitive Elections,"My name is Barbara and I have been a resident of Waterford Township for 50 years. I want to thank the members of the commission for the time and energy you are devoting to making Michigan's voting districts fair and competitive using the input of citizens in such a democratic way. You are truly appreciated! Waterford Township and the City of Pontiac share a boundary on Waterford's east and we really share many issues and interests. We share a fire department, students who attend K-12 and alternative schools of choice, the Oakland County Complex and Farm Market, M-59 and Telegraph Rds, churches, jobs and businesses, etc. However, Waterford is in the 11th Congressional District, a torturously gerrymandered district that extends south to Wayne County, skirting almost all Democratic leaning communities, while Pontiac is in the 14th.  Waterford is a mostly square township, in the center of square Oakland County. Yet we have two state representatives, when we could have one, and a gerrymandered state senate district. Recently it was said that in Michigan, it takes 1 1/2 Democratic votes to 1 Republican vote to win an election because of gerrymandering. In half of our MI elections in the last two decades, Republicans have won despite losing the popular vote. That does not reflect the will of the people. Ending gerrymandering will help solve this problem. "

While Ann Arbor, MI is reliably ""blue"" area, we have some commonalities based upon our Intermediate School District as well as communities who feed our workforce in meaningful ways.   I would suggest that to our west both Dexter and Chelsea share in an economic vitality and do depend on Ann Arbor for their employment or cultural vitality. At the same time,  our ISD  reaches to communities in the  Ypsilanti area that in many cases seem closer to their neighbors to their east than Ann Arbor proper.    I don't like the idea of splitting an ISD community, but Ann Arbor is not just a suburb of metro-Detroit,  and  has a personality and economic vitality that is independent of Detroit but does not seem to be otherwise represented in the redistricting public hearings.   Thank you. Your effort is appreciated."
1204,written,,,Considerations for fair district maps,"Hello,  It is important that the focus of the redistricting efforts be on drawing districts that are regularly shaped and represent the people in the district who share city/county of residence, school district, socio-economic and other common attributes.  This does not include religious beliefs. While I respect that our constitution allows for freedom of religion, our country is founded on the separation of church and state for good reason.  We are secular society and as such the redistricting efforts should be conducted through that lens. "

Schools are the lifeblood of any community and will draw together people with a common interest in an apolitical manner.   My experience has been that school systems naturally bring together families of varying demographics and it would seem to me to make sense to use this as a starting point.  I understand there are over 800 of them statewide so some sort of consolidation would be necessary.  The reason why I like this approach is because it attempts to keep local people voting and participating locally, instead of current districts that are so large that is lost.  Thanks for your service, time and consideration.  "

They have literally become an anti-American party.  I see a lot of well organized comments on this website calling to end gerrymandering yet in the same breath encourage changes that will help these fringe extremists gain power.  In a truly fair redistricting, the majority will have a voice, not a fringe group of soros funded activists, and we would see a lot more reasonable, moderate, pro-life Blue Dog Democrats getting elected, instead of these shrill, screaming, communist-wannabes."

The e: mail indicated “Communities of Interest DO NOT include relationships with political parties, incumbents, or political candidates.”  Yet later in the e: mail two questions were asked that pertain to politics: 1)	How would keeping your community intact enhance the quality of your representation in the Michigan legislature or U.S. Congress? 2)	What governmental policies are important for your community? Changes by Michigan Legislatures and U.S. Congress are dependent on who gets elected to office. Therefore, it most definitely pertains to politics. Many governmental policies are also affected by how a person votes, so this also pertains to politics.  If “Communities of Interest” are permitted, will the erosion of redistricting begin? "
1213,written,,oakland county,"Communities, Fairness & Representation","Dear Commissioners:  As an applicant for Michigan’s Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission (specifically one of the non-partisan positions), I have been and remain interested in the redistricting process.  Among my main concerns are that the process be undertaken in a manner which results in districts which, to the greatest extent possible, do not dilute or concentrate a party's or a demographic group's power - with the goal being to provide appropriate representation to such party's and group's member(s).  With respect to the ""Communities of Interest"" criteria, I (like most people) consider myself a member of many such communities.  As a resident of Beverly Hills (Birmingham school district), I feel that the cultural/social/economic interests of my area and its population are most closely tied to municipalities like Birmingham and Bloomfield and to a lesser extent Berkley and Royal Oak.  On a cultural level, as a Jewish American, my community is more broadly based in central and southern Oakland County (with little membership in the most northern and the northwestern portions of the County).  With regard to this latter community, given that there is only one current Jewish member of the State House, I think it is pretty clear that keeping this community intact provides the greatest likelihood of it having at least one voice in State government.    I would also like to point out several other communities in the western and central parts of Oakland County that should be considered during the district drawing process.  With respect to communities that share characteristics, the populations of Farmington and Novi are similar to each other in both educational attainment and demographically (e.g., both have significant Black and AAPI communities, unlike most of the areas surrounding them).  Also, the City of Waterford aligns rather closely with West Bloomfield (moreso anyway than with its rural neighbors).  With regard to the State House, each of Farmington, Novi (with Wixom), and Waterford all make sense as districts based upon their makeups (and have the additional benefit of being compact and neat).  Similarly, Milford, Lyon Township (even including South Lyon) and the surrounding townships to the north are largely exurban and small towns.  (With Milford, Highland, and White Lake comprising the Huron Valley School District, and with Milford and South Lyon being rival high schools.)  Although larger in size (both in terms of land area and population), State Senate districts also seem much more likely to reflect similar communities and to do a better job or providing representation for various populations if they are drawn vertically so that areas like (i) Farmington Hills/Novi, and (ii) Auburn Hills/Pontiac/West Bloomfield are grouped together.  In summary, paying attention to the above-referenced communities and drawing district lines vertically (State Senate) and such that cities/townships are kept together where possible (State House) will go a long way toward providing for competitive and fair districts and will also help address and satisfy several of the criteria the Commission is supposed to follow, including: ensuring geographic continuity; reflecting Michigan's diverse population and ""communities of interest;"" ensuring partisan fairness by not disproportionately advantaging a political party; reflecting consideration of county, city and township boundaries; and achieving compactness.

Keeping a sense of unity in values while still encouraging reasonable competition among candidates within a district can encourage improvement and resilience over stagnation. The people within every district deserve to be listened to and valued, which can in turn lead to economic growth, healthier populations, and new solutions, and this is best achieved by avoiding gerrymandering, which only benefits those already in power.

This needs correcting immediately. 
1222,written,,,Speaker #44 on 10 June 2021 (Pontiac),"A solution exists that satisfies all 7 mandates your have been directed to achieve by the constitutional amendment we, together, enacted. Our elected representatives failed us. Thank you for your service in this thankless yet vital civic task.  The case for proportional representation was made by John Stuart Mill in his 1861 essay ""Considerations on Representative Government"":  In a representative body actually deliberating, the minority must of course be overruled; and in an equal democracy, the majority of the people, through their representatives, will outvote and prevail over the minority and their representatives. But does it follow that the minority should have no representatives at all? ... Is it necessary that the minority should not even be heard? Nothing but habit and old association can reconcile any reasonable being to the needless injustice. In a really equal democracy, every or any section would be represented, not disproportionately, but proportionately. A majority of the electors would always have a majority of the representatives, but a minority of the electors would always have a minority of the representatives. Man for man, they would be as fully represented as the majority. Unless they are, there is not equal government ... there is a part whose fair and equal share of influence in the representation is withheld from them, contrary to all just government, but, above all, contrary to the principle of democracy, which professes equality as its very root and foundation.  Michiganders agree with Mill, that in a representative democracy the representatives should represent ALL substantial segments of society — but want reform rather than abolition of direct local community representation in the legislature.   One of the earliest proposals of proportionality in an assembly was by John Adams in his influential pamphlet ""Thoughts on Government"", written in 1776 during the American Revolution: It should be in miniature, an exact portrait of the people at large. It should think, feel, reason, and act like them. That it may be the interest of this Assembly to do strict justice at all times, it should be an equal representation, or in other words equal interest among the people should have equal interest in it.  Thomas Jefferson has given us the model to use for proportional representation that is NON-PARTISAN. You must NOT use redistricting biased toward the unconstitutional party system which is inherently skewed toward the good-old boy, back-room, party-boss, us-versus-them failed GOP-Democrat party methods. You must REJECT the Hunting-Hill method and the D'Hondt method given they cannot mathematically ever achieve all 7 of the mandates you are directed to achieve.   The Jefferson method uses a quota, called a divisor, as in the largest remainder method. The Jefferson method is NOT equal to the D'Hondt method and DOES provide compact and continuous equal representation for the 13 Congressional representatives assigned federal districts that is mathematically proportional to the population of citizens in the 2020 census according to the existing geometric boundaries Michigan has used for its counties and also falls along most of the 206 current State districts for the 143 local representatives.   I will submit the map which results from the application of Jefferson's method that depicts the 13 federal districts as compact and continguous. I will also include the associated State-level districts that are naturally associated with the 13 federal districts.  Thank you, again, for conducting these hearings and for volunteering for such an important civic duty."
1223,written,,,Don't split Downriver,"I live in one of metro Detroit's most distinct communities of interest, it's a collection of 18 municipalities called Downriver.   The 18 cities and townships in Downriver are: Allen Park, Brownstown, Ecorse, Flat Rock, Gibraltar, Grosse Ile, Huron Township, Lincoln Park, Melvindale, River Rouge, Riverview, Rockwood, Romulus, Southgate, Taylor, Trenton, Woodhaven, and Wyandotte.  The collective identity of us ""Downriverites"" is strong. Our area is a region where small businesses thrive, and we couldn't be more proud. Yet our area has been split among multiple congressional districts for decades. My town, Melvindale, for example, is cut off from the bulk of Downriver communities, and is instead put in the same district as places like Highland Park and Garden City, which have very little, if anything, in common with Melvindale.  Downriver only has a population of about 350,000; so other surrounding areas would have to be added to our congressional district. Some definitions of Downriver include Dearborn, Dearborn Heights, Sumpter, Van Buren, Belleville, and some of the northern townships of Monroe County. Many people there also consider themselves to be Downriverites.  What's most important is that all of the 18 core Downriver municipalities all be put in the same congressional district. Please keep us together!"
1224,written,,,Keep Shiawassee County whole,"As constituent of the 85th House District and the 24th Senate District, this is how redistricting should be done regarding Shiawassee County which makes up the vast majority of the 85th House District that currently includes 6 townships from the southwest corner of Saginaw County, and regarding the 24th Michigan Senate District that includes Shiawassee, Clinton, and Eaton Counties, and 5 townships from Ingham County, and lastly Shiawassee County as part of the 4th U.S. Congressional District.  Shiawassee County historically has been kept whole for redistricting purposes for the Michigan House and Senate Districts and a U.S. Congressional District meeting the redistricting criteria of Compactness, Contiguity, and the Polsby-Popper Score requirements. It also should rate a high Reock Score keeping to the area of the smallest possible circle redistricting requirement.  Shiawassee County also meets the redistricting criteria of Competitiveness, Incumbency, Packing and Cracking, and Partisan Fairness as historically the county votes in a way that can result in candidates from either party winning.  In the spirit of the Communities of Interest redistricting criteria that requires “populations that share cultural or historical characteristics or economic interests” be taken into consideration for redistricting, Shiawassee County  shares a common culture and historical background with common economic interests. Shiawassee County is primarily rural with agriculture, small business and businesses that are automotive related making up the primary economic interests.   Shiawassee County has a population of 68,000 which is close to the 77-91,000 population requirement to be a Michigan House District by itself. The County is historically joined with a few townships from an adjoining county of similar cultural, historical and economic interests to make up a Michigan House District.  To redistrict Shiawassee County in way that would divide it up electorally would artificially divide a population that would be detrimental historically, culturally and economically. I urge you to keep Shiawassee County as primarily its own Michigan House District and to keep it whole for purposes of creating a Michigan Senate District and a U.S. Congressional District by combing it with other counties of similar cultural, historical and economic interests.  Thank you."
1225,written,,,MI-3 is silly,"I tend to vote red, libertarian, or US Taxpayers party, but even I get that MI-3 being red is ridiculous. Sure, Trump signs weren't hard to find, or signs for the Libertarian candidate, but once you entered GR proper, in a space that 3 people live in OUT of GR, six voters might be in IN GR, and it's all rainbow flags and BLM. (Not trying to start a fight on any of this--trying to make a point here.) The fact that they're represented by a Republican is ridiculous and shows how BADLY gerrymandered this district is.  I think Peter Meijer should be a single-term Representative for many reasons, but a huge one, the biggest, is because his very position is a result of generations of gerrymandering to dilude the reality: GR is sapphire blue.  I grew up in a district in IL that was gerrymandered the opposite way--to dilude non-blue votes, and both are unjust. At least I can do something about it here. Fix MI-3 so it actually represents the population and doesn't just serve to keep fat, lazy idiots in Lansing in power."

We want competitive districts (no stacking or packing, etc.)  I believe that the voters are best served when we have an actual choice instead of who represents us based on their stands on the issues.

We have the opportunity to ensure fair representation among our communities, not dividing us based on race, majority, minority but how we live our lives and who we live them with.  Part of providing a voice to our communities is to reduce the so called ""Safe Seats"" to ensure that no representative is beyond accountability if they choose not to represent their constituents.   All discussions, considerations and judgements should be guided by these two principals.  Thank you for your time!"

As it currently exists Troy is a diverse and well-functioning community.  I believe breaking it up would be detrimental to these organizations, it’s citizens and serve no positive propose.

I am an elected Precinct Delegate from Royal Oak to the Oakland County Democratic Convention.  I tell you this to provide full disclosure of my background and possible biases.   First of all I want to thank you all for volunteering to be members of this commission.  Its constitutional mandate to redraw districts independently is one of the most important tasks in our state.  I have lived in Michigan for thirty years, and have been appalled by the discrepancies in representation in that time.  In this century alone, since the last two Republican gerrymandered redistricting efforts, Republicans running for state House collectively won more votes than Democrats 3 times, but amazingly won a majority of seats 8 times.  The state Senate has stayed in Republican control that entire time despite Democrats winning the aggregate votes.  Similar disparities have occurred, to a lesser extent, among the Michigan delegation to the US House of Representatives.  This is all because of unfair gerrymandering of districts, in which Democrats have been shoe-horned as the super-majority into a few oddly shaped districts, giving Republicans a majority in many more districts.  I am here to ask you to fulfil the constitutional mandate of your commission by redrawing districts fairly, and ending the partisan engineered districts we have lived with all these years.  Thank you."
1235,written,,suburb,Suburbs as a Community of Interest,"My concept is simple.  There are many similarities in local communities and there is a connection between those of similar age.    A community’s character is very often shared by neighboring communities.  Many of these similarities are based around commerce or zoning. Examples include an area defined by Birmingham, Troy and Bloomfield Hill; another would be River Rouge, Melvindale and Ecorse; a final example is Westland, Garden City and Livonia.   Age as I am using it here is not necessarily the date the community was founded but when most of its growth in population occurred.  These would be communities facing similar issues of aging infrastructure, generational change and other demographic changes.  I appreciate your attention and your work. "
1236,written,,,Unite Border Counties,"Honorable Commissioners,    As a resident of Lenawee County, a border county, and a Certified Public Accountant who deals with complex tax issues and business policies, as well as business regulations for my clients and myself, I am writing to ask that you leave our southern border counties united in the redistricting map—Monroe, Lenawee, Hillsdale, and possibly even Branch for bigger areas of representation. Businesses in border counties are affected by tax and business policies established In Lansing and Washington D.C., which are different from non-border counties.  When we’ve had a divided representation our representatives often don’t really understand our issues or speak with our voice.  They are often more divided in their focus and in their accountability to us.  When we border counties/areas can be united, it has helped us have a stronger voice for our specific concerns.  Our representatives have lived and experienced the special challenges that we face when we have to compete with Ohio and Indiana.  Some recurring examples are when gas, cigarette, and alcohol taxes are raised.  I see a big effect on my clients who are then at a major disadvantage with businesses in the states to the south of us.   Splintering our voice and our representation would discriminate against us, be less efficient, and be overall more costly and less productive.  Thank you for considering Monroe, Lenawee, Hillsdale, and possibly Branch in this manner.      Jeff Yeutter"
1237,written,,,Presque Isle County Plan,"The area of Northeast Michigan in which I reside is the county of Presque Isle off of Lake Huron. The area is known for its nautical themes, Polish and German heritage, and potatoes set in a 1950s era Norman Rockwell style town. The idyllic scenes of perfectly manicured parks, lawns, with an edge of dilapidation from the long ago forgotten homes and schools that have been left to rot away. This community, however, is strong with our common bond being the well fair and well-being of each other and these towns that we care so much about. In this regard, however, I would not mind being split from my county and it would be better enhanced if their was more diversity in this county. The representation in the Michigan legislature and my representative in Congress do not represent who I or my family are as people, yet there is an unmistakable coldness casted to the people who are different. This community does not fully believe in the pandemic and cares more about the second amendment and their individual rights. While I and a small growing few believe in cleaner energy and less pipelines. A better future for our children and less of a carbon footprint. More love and less hate.  Due to the lack of resources in this area it would seem that the area itself is slowly dying and is a weakness in and of itself. However, there are a lot of strengths that can be found. Due to lack of big box stores and fast food we have a community full of small eclectic shops, boutiques, coffee places, art studios, churches, and festivals/craft fairs. It thrives even as it dies. Luckily, with tourism from Mackinac, Cheboygan, and other surrounding areas, we do tend to get a lot more foot traffic in the area during the summer months. However, with a lack of an overall population growth increase I fear the surrounding towns are slowly dying."
1238,written,,,We don't need more division,"After reading numerous comments I get the sense that most of you want ‘your political party’ to be favored by changing  boundaries to benefit the party line.  It seems to me that setting boundaries has caused a great divide and will increase to do so, which is in tune with what is going on at all levels of government in America today.  People are always moving within and into and outside the State - demographics will always be fluid. Pretty soon we will have increased numbers of boundaries to suit each political party and will still have a lack of real representation of the American people.  Representatives should serve all the people, not just their political party, which is exactly what has been created. There has been no cooperation or compromise for years because of this continued idea that division is needed.  As a result  we are losing our cities, counties, States and America.  Most Representatives are not fighting for your city or America but a global ideology which is based on division.  Until the public cares more about improving their community and State with regard to business opportunities, safety and infrastructure we will continue to have these issues.  Honor, integrity, responsibility and accountability has been taken out of political office and replaced with lifetime terms with benefits that the general public will never experience, but continues to pay for.  Politicians certainly don’t and won’t govern themselves … what a scam they have going!  Everyone should have a chance to represented.  What we need is not more division, but to simplify this monstrous system we have allowed and to ensure that all elections are honest and fair. "

If you look at a map of the current congressional districts in southeast Michigan, I think you could say they rival the complexity of those back in 1812. They are a mess. I am what I consider to be a Metro Detroit ""west-sider"" always have been. I grew up in Oakland County west of Woodward Ave. I have many family and friends who live in the Metro Detroit east-side and we would all agree that there are self-described cultural distinction between east and west siders. The unofficial demarcation between east and west would be I75 coming out of Detroit. In 1978 I moved to Northville Twp. and have lived there in Western Wayne County ever since. I've watched the area grow westerly without the constraints of a Lake St. Claire or a Detroit River to impede the growth, only open farmland that has gradually been converted to residential and industrial use. In Northville, we share the same concerns over zoning, water, sewage, schools, roads and even landfills as our neighboring communities of Canton, Plymouth and even The City of Novi in Oakland County to the north of us. Essentially those communities that run westerly along the I275 corridor. I encourage age you to please take into consideration the common concerns that these expanding western Wayne and Oakland Counties share. You have a terrific opportunity to create something enduring. A model for the future and possibly even for other states. Make them fair, square and as compact as possible without crossing city, township or municipal lines. Thank you."

My issue with its current formation is the higher population areas (the outskirts of Lansing, Ann Arbor, etc) don’t mesh with the values of the vast majority of the district. It was definitely drawn to give the current representation at strong base to ensure re-election. I would prefer to be grouped with others who live close to my area (I live in a suburb of Lansing) then those who live in practically Ohio. My voice has always been suppressed in this district and I would like to see this district made competitive for people of all political views, not just the side of the current representation. "
1244,written,,,General Comment,"When I signed the petition to place redistricting on the ballot I did so because of the extremely partisan nature of the plan that was in place at that time. One look at a state map showed the absurdity of those who had drawn it. I hoped and argued for the mostly nonpartisan dynamics of the amendment. At the time I was not comfortable with the ""Communities of Interest"" but compromised to ensure the success of the amendment's passage.  The map that I envisioned was based on geography, number of voters and accommodation of  contiguous civic borders, i.e. cities, towns, townships and counties - true nonpartisan, non-biased criteria. How are COAs any different from a political party? One person, one vote- PLEASE KEEP IT SIMPLE! "

1246,written,,,Restore Balance to our political system,"Michigan, like all states is a great mix of ideas and perspectives on how to govern ourselves.  Unfortunately gerrymandering has pretty much destroyed our ability to entertain these many perspectives and to work together as a people to govern equitably.  The politically imbalanced voting districts in our state have led to the highly partisan primaries being more important to a candidate’s success than the general election, and as a result, have resulted in more extreme candidates winning elections by catering to the needs and wants of only a fraction of the community. I would encourage the members of the commission to focus on making our new districts more balanced in terms of party affiliation.  While this may not be possible in certain areas of the state, where the communities of interest are more homogenous, a majority of the new districts should be designed with a bias in favor of equal balance of democrat, republican, and most importantly, with a significant proportion of Independent voters.   If a district supports equal proportions of partisan voters, more elections would be decided by the non-partisan independent voters in those districts who tend to vote in favor of the better ideas/candidate and not based upon the D or R behind the candidate’s name.  Candidates would be forced to take these independent voters needs into account when governing, leading to less extreme policy positions and less rancorous campaigning.   Parties will soon learn that putting extremely partisan candidates or platforms up for general election will result in election losses.  When that starts to happen, cooperation and comprise will be restored to our state and we can start working together to make Michigan a place where everyone feels they have a say. "

I’m a resident of Plymouth Township in Wayne County.     My communities of interest are Plymouth and Northville.  These contiguous communities have many things in common.  They are a place where you want to raise your family and enjoy your retirement.  Each has a city with excellent restaurants, shopping and small businesses, and there are many places to worship.  Both school districts are excellent, and in some areas, Northville students attend Plymouth Canton schools.  Not everyone shares the same political ideologies; however, we all respect each other’s right to their own opinion.  In these communities, if someone’s lawn is overgrown, instead of calling an ordinance officer, we would walk over and see if our neighbor needs help.  Besides the great quality of life and education, these communities participate jointly in economic development, mutual aid, and share the 35th District Court.  The MITC, which stands for the Michigan International Technology Center, is a collaborative real estate development initiative between the Plymouth and Northville communities.  Many leading automotive research and development firms have chosen to be located within the MITC, and the area is designed for an elite class of global technology, mobility, life science and engineering innovators.    There is a small part of the City of Northville that is in Oakland County, and I am asking that it stays part of the Plymouth Northville district.

1249,written,,,Keep Bay County with Saginaw-Genesee,"BAY - SAGINAW - MIDLAND COMMUNITY OF INTEREST FOR STATE SENATE MAP  BAY-SAGINAW-GENESEE FOR CONGRESSIONAL MAP  My name is Karen Tighe.  I’m a retired judge, and have lived and worked in Bay County for over 40 years.  I’d like to discuss the State Senate and Congressional maps.  Two decades ago, Bay County was gerrymandered away from its closest community (Saginaw) and placed into a rural State Senate district with Tuscola and Lapeer counties.  Our most recent state senators are family farmers whose interests are, understandably, centered on agriculture. The issues of an urban-suburban community on the northern edge of the industrial corridor have not been their focus or interest.    We identify our COI as the Tri-Cities and Tri-Counties of Bay Saginaw and Midland.  We share an international airport with the initials MBS - administered by our 3 local governments. We share Delta College - a community college supported by Tri-County tax millages and whose board members are elected from each of our three counties. We share Saginaw Valley State University which attracts students from our communities who can remain home while pursuing higher education.  The U.S. Office of Management and Budget literally defines Bay-Saginaw-Midland as a “United States Metropolitan Area” characterized by a relatively high population density and close economic ties.  Our economies developed because of our proximity to the navigable Saginaw River, one of the few inland rivers in Michigan large/deep/wide enough to allow for commercial shipping.  Our cities provide access to the freighters which deliver iron ore and raw materials for the auto industry, and carry stone from our stone docks to other ports in the Great Lakes.  Midland’s city developed on the banks of the Tittabewasse, which flows into the Saginaw River.  Saginaw and Bay City developed on both sides of the Saginaw River.  Midland became world HQ for Dow Chemical, while Bay City and Saginaw are home to General Motors Powertrain plants.  Our area’s largest local employer is the former Saginaw Steering Gear, now Nexteer, which provides over 5000 local jobs.  Nexteer is located adjacent to I-75, cementing Saginaw and Bay counties on the northern edge of Michigan’s industrial corridor.  Our television networks recognize Flint-Saginaw-Bay City-Midland as a discrete Media Market. Lapeer County receives its local news from Detroit affiliates, which leaves our elected state senator out of our mid-Michigan news loop.   The metro area of Bay-Sag-Midland is large enough to support a Costo (built on the Bay-Midland county line) and the big box stores such as Macy’s, Target, Barnes & Noble, Sam’s Club, Cabelas, JCPenney, Wal-Marts, Home Depots and others.  People from our COI regularly traverse county lines to patronize the overlapping businesses located here.  Likewise, our recreational venues are used by residents of the Tri-city metro area:  Saginaw Spirit Junior Hockey Team, Great Lakes Loons Baseball Team, and the Riverwalk and festivals held at Bay City’s Wenona Park and Saginaw’s Bavarian Frankenmuth.  A metropolitan region such as ours deserves representation in the State Senate by a person who lives and works in the Tri-counties.  We urge you to recognize the Tri-counties -- or more precisely the cities and suburban townships of Saginaw, Bay City and Midland, as a Community of Interest when you redraw the State Senate map.   ___________________________  The above narrative also bolsters the idea that Bay County should remain with Saginaw and Genesee for Congressional representation.  We are currently in the 5th congressional district where we share a COI with our urban industrial neighbors to the south.  Bay County is the northernmost area of the UAW’s Region 1-A, which encompasses Detroit, Flint, Saginaw, and Bay City.  Here is a link to the map, illustrating that industrial Region 1-A (dark blue) stretches from Michigan’s southern border, narrowing up I-75 to include Bay City:  www.uaw.org/regions/    Our location on the I-75 corridor puts us squarely with the urban communities south of us as our COI for Congress.  With Flint and Saginaw, we share the shipping and trucking routes for the industries that grew up here, as well as aging urban infrastructure, roads and bridges in need of repair, and our mutual watershed.  These are all areas where it makes sense to be represented by the same congressperson.  We hope you will consider Bay County to be part of the Genesee-Saginaw COI for Congress.  Thank you for your consideration and the valuable work you are doing for fair representation.   Karen Tighe Essexville, Bay County, MI "

The beauty of having the choice to settle in a community that has common values, beliefs, etc is what makes America so great.  From the list of all of the places I've lived, I chose to ""come back home"" because Livingston County/ Hamburg Twp/Livingston County all share the same values of God, family, freedom and love for our great state and nation.  Livingston County is unique in that it has larger towns, small villages, flashing red lights instead of stop-lights and dirt roads (I happen to live on one).  It takes a certain mindset to live in a community where you have to drive 20 minutes to get to a grocery store.  We like the small town feel and we'd like to keep it that way.  My kids attended public school in Livingston County, played community and school sports, we attend church in this county. The young man (15 year old, Eli, I think) who spoke publicly at the  Novi meeting had it right.  My kids, too, played sports in jr high and high school with other schools in the county where they would play against their friends from church, youth group or AAU team. This was a rich experience for them and for me.  My friendships were those parents who play with and against my kids in sports.   Please keep Livingston County together and don't split it up. Thank you,"
1251,written,,,Public Comment on redistricting ,"Hi there! My name is Ani and I'm a Michigander currently residing in Chesterfield Township in Macomb County. It is no secret that Michigan's legislative districts are drawn to favor one party over the other. This is demonstrated most profusely in southeast Michigan's counties of Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb with how their districts are currently designed. As such the commission must, in order to accurately adhere to the will of the voters through the passing of Prop 2 in 2018, do the following:  Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb Counties deserve a fair redraw from its current maps that promote extreme levels of gerrymandering; The tri-county area is a diverse place and currently, the maps do not fully reflect that diversity of demographics, industries, and common interests; And the maps should be competitive giving candidates a fair chance to win, not having to fight through seemingly pre-determined outcomes in overwhelmingly ""safe districts.""  I hope you'll take these items into consideration while drawing your maps. I also hope you will reflect the will of the people in their passing of Prop 2 in 2018 by ending partisan district making and giving the people what our state needs: a fair redistricting that will accurately reflect Michigan and its residents.

Currently, seven counties are broken into two or more Districts: Kent, Montcalm, Saginaw, Washtenaw, Macomb, Oakland and Wayne.  Altought I have concerns for the prior three, I have even more concern for the latter four: Washtenaw, Macomb, and especially Oakland and Wayne Counties, in Southeast Michigan.  I believe counties should be kept whole.  When they cannot be kept whole, I believe they should be divided by North-South lines along Township lines, as practically as possible.  Any deviations should be along East-West Township lines, or City, Town, Village or Neighborhood lines, keeping said units intact, as practically possible."

1254,written,,,Suggestion for Drawing Fair Maps,"Dear Members of the Michigan Redistricting Commission,  Thank you for your commitment to public service and for the critical work you are doing as  members of the Commission.  And thank you for inviting input from the public.  I thought you might be interested in an updated version of the Guide to Redistricting which was prepared for citizens and members of redistricting commissions, as well as legislators and judges. The Guide now contains a section on Lessons Learned.  It discusses why Fair Maps are so important, and describes explicitly how to construct maps that eradicate gerrymandering. Maps for three states are presented where the districts are compact, contiguous and meet the population requirements. The maps provide representation for minorities and communities of interest, and attend to local jurisdictional boundaries. The maps produce legislatures which are competitive and representationally fair.  The maps are drawn so the party distribution of likely representatives matches the distribution of the state’s voting behavior.  Gerrymandering is eliminated and representative democracy prevails. https://preprints.apsanet.org/engage/api-gateway/apsa/assets/orp/resource/item/60ad2609f9118a6736fdb6a6/original/fair-and-square-redistricting.pdf (This work has garnered more than 1,200 views and 450  downloads on the Preprints Page of the American Political Science Association)  Respectfully and Gratefully Submitted,   James N. Fox "
1255,written,,,compactness,"Citizen engagement is far easier if districts can be described in simple words and use preexisting boundaries.  If my representative represented Northville, Plymouth, and Canton everyone would know who is in and outside of the district.  This would help elected officials (which parades to attend!).  It would help potential candidates.  It would help local officials (Northville would be represented by one representative, very neat.)  It would make it easier for voters to know their district. It would help activists promoting causes.  Lines should be preexisting and districts should be compact and to the extent possible using already existing cities and towns and neighborhoods.  If you need a map to figure out whom someone represents, it's not a good district."

Tonight, I want to address the “communities of interest,” Midland county, Gladwin county, and the surrounding townships within District 4.      One year ago, these counties had suffered catastrophic, historic flooding that wiped out several businesses, destroyed numerous homes beyond repair and neighborhoods beyond recognition. Many in our communities lost everything!      The evacuation process during the disaster was a combined effort of our counties police, firefighters and EMT and how hard they worked—making it a priority to ensure the safety of the people evacuating the area and the transporting of patients from Mid Michigan Health facilities in Midland to other safe facilities throughout our counties. Retirement relocation decisions were easy to make for my husband and me. It was based on the amazing people and of course the recreational water amenities they had to offer. The Tittabawassee River being the largest watershed that flows through our counties and did provide endless hours of enjoyment.  But now priorities have changed since the floods. We are now in recovery and restoration mode and helping our businesses and citizens rebuilt so that they can stay in the counties they love and have lived in for so long. Therefore, I am asking the commission to consider these “communities of interest” of Midland/Gladwin county to remain intact in their existing district, District 4. This will allow the communities to continue their recovery together by working with their same local departments that they began with one year ago.  We will be strong again working together! God Bless and thank you for your time. "

1259,written,,,Educational Communities of Interest ,"Joellen Pisarczyk 4119 Howe Place Howell MI – Former Teacher & Livingston County resident over 20 years.    EDUCATIONAL COMMUNITIES of interest include: Public, Private & Charter Schools as well as Homeschoolers, Adult & Senior programs. Collectively, these Educational Communities are highly interconnected by County resources, funding, facilities, businesses, support services, and serve shared values across a spectrum of needs within the county.    EDUCATIONAL COMMUNITIES are: By necessity of short commute times, GEOGRAPHICALLY CLUSTERED and interconnected and must be represented collectively.    Important Examples Educational Communities share:  1.	TRANSPORTATION – Under Michigan law, PUBLIC & PRIVATE schools SHARE local school bus service. Tax-payer funded community bus service (Livingston Essential Transportation Service) also provides essential student ACCESS.  2.	SHARED RESOURCES & SERVICES - TEACHING STAFF are often shared between public, private & Homeschool Groups. Courses in Music, Foreign Language, Advanced Placement classes, College Dual Enrollment, tutoring, College Admissions Test Preparation, Psychological & medical services, library & technology centers, Business & Industry collaborations for vocational experiences and internships are part of the county HUB of support. Two key examples include the Brighton Area Schools STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts & mathematics) & ROBOTICS programs supported by local businesses such as General Motors and a host of other smaller businesses within the county. Special Needs Students also receive support services by the county Livingston Educational Service Agency (LESA), and through hands-on learning through sheltered workshops & local employers.   3.	EXTRACURRICULAR PROGRAMS - Athletic & Academic Clubs, Science Olympiad, Robotics, Adult Education, Performing Arts… are examples of groups who all interact on local fields, in stadiums, buildings, & community pools.   4.	FUNDING - Local & state tax revenue and local BONDS pay for the services, infrastructure, working capital, and program operating funds.    In summary: Oversight, funding, support, and public safety services are provided within the county for Educational Communities. Focusing district representation compactly within Livingston County will keep the Educational Community INTACT as a central HUB to provide for important and diverse student needs.  Thank you for your hard work on this process.   "
1260,written,,,Midland MI Community of Interest,"I am writing to express my opinion on the subject of redistricting. I ask that you maintain the community of interest of Midland County and the mid-Michigan region for the current 4th Congressional District, as well as the current  State Senate and State Representative lines for Midland.  7 Words.  Agriculture. Rural. Manufacturing. Employment. Education. Geography. Health. These seven words describe the connectedness, the linkage of Midland and MidMichigan.  Midland and mid-Michigan counties of Midland, Gladwin, Isabella, Gratiot, Clare and Saginaw are a community of interest linked with a rural heritage and a strong agricultural commonality throughout the mid-Michigan region.  Employment and Manufacturing. History of the  Dow Chemical Company in Midland and the plastic extrusion business in Gladwin have supplied good paying jobs for residents of Mid-Michigan for decades.  Let's not fracture this common linkage, this community of employment.  Education: There is a rich heritage of education connectedness in Mid-Michigan. Northwood University, Mid-Michigan Community College in Harrison, in Clare County; CMU in Isabella; Delta College's brand new Downtown Campus and SVSU which serves Mid-Michigan communities and was created by the communities of Midland, Saginaw and Bay.  Geography of mid-MIchigan and the Tittabawassee River watershed has always been a strong community of interest since the logging days, to the global manufacturing giant serving Midland and Gladwin and the neighboring counties.    The Tri-City airport, sometimes referred to as MBS for Midland-Bay-Saginaw serves a major transportation community of interest for Midland, Gladwin, Clare, Gratiot and Saginaw and Bay Counties.  More southern counties Genesee , Shiawassee, Lapeer, generally use a different airport in Flint-Genesee County, NOT the airport of Midland-Bay-Saginaw.  Hospital care and Health care is consistently delivered by Mid-Michigan Health Care throughout mid-Michgan, with hospitals and clinics in Midland, Gladwin, Mt. Pleasant, Clare, West Branch.  This is my ask:  please maintain the integrity, the history, the common interest of education, health care, employment, rural-agricultural linkage of Midland, Gladwin, Clare, Saginaw, Isabella, Gratiot counties.    I ask that you do not cut up, slice up, carve up, break up Midland and Mid-Michigan for narrow, political purposes.   Please maintain the current Congressional map of the 4th district which includes Midland and Gladwin, Isabella, Clare, Gratiot and Saginaw and the cohesiveness and linkage of these communities in the state senate and state representatives seats as well.   "
1261,written,,,seats consistent with state vote totals,"I helped with the campaign to establish the Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission. My prime motivation was a conviction that the balance of political power in Lansing should reflect the statewide vote totals. If Party A received 55% of the votes statewide, something is seriously wrong if Party B has majorities in both houses while receiving only 40% of the total statewide votes. These numbers are hypothetical.  I hope that after redistricting, the balance of power in the state house and senate accurately reflects statewide vote counts."

Redrawing our districts is an opportunity for communities to be  represented by someone who reflects their values, interests, culture, religion, and other important characteristics.  That individual will hopefully then fight on the community’s behalf and advocate for their best interest.  Nearly 80 percent of the estimated  278,000 residents in Michigan who identify as Arab American live in metro Detroit. A significant majority of them reside here in Dearborn.   A major concern is that those who of us who identify as Arab are not accounted for on Census, since it is not an official category. instead, we tend to fall into other categories that don’t necessarily represent our identities. With this, the unique needs and characteristics of our community go unaccounted for and overlooked.   As you deliberate on how to redraw these districts, I urge you to consider the collective identity and shared interests of our vibrant and resilient immigrant and Muslim communities.   Consider the importance of keeping districts that house major employers like Ford Motor Company, Beaumont, and Henry Ford Health system intact.   Consider our major academic institutions like the university of Michigan Dearborn and Henry Ford college, or cultural sites like the Arab American museum and Henry Ford museum, and the importance of advocacy for continued funding and support to encourage further growth.

This organization has families of diverse backgrounds that come together to enrich the educational experiences of our children.  Our reasons for home education vary, though we generally agree that the state’s offerings are not meeting our needs and have different values than those of our family.  I have noticed the majority of our families choose to live in ways that align with Monroe county.  We seek time outdoors, attempt to grow or hunt our own food, participate in faith communities and look for ways to actively serve the less fortunate. Our professions include sales, engineers, auto assembly, truck drivers, bakers, artists, teachers and many more, but we come together in how we educate our children.   We choose where we live for a purpose.  Sharing our lives with people of different backgrounds and the same values.

I lived in Farmington Hills for many years and the voting districts changed constantly to favor the political party in power.  The district boundaries made no sense other than to skew the outcome of upcoming elections. Do something to safeguard the integrity of our elections.

Redistricting Oshtemo with WMU's campus would give a more diverse population of voters. This is crucial because people of all races, genders, and sexual orientations should have a say in what goes on in their community. Many WMU students reside in Oshtemo.

1266,written,,,Public Comment For 6/27/2021 Session In ,"To: The members of the Michigan Citizens Redistricting Committee.  I was unable to attend the public information session in Lansing this evening (6/27/2021). I did attend via Zoom. What follows are my comments to be added to the public comment section of the Lansing session.  I was an independent applicant for the MICRC. It is exciting to see the Commission in action. Had I been selected, my priorities for drawing district boundaries would have been, in the following order, as follows:  1.  House, Senate and Congressional districts boundaries should be drawn in such a manner that each district would be as competitive as possible. I don't know that there wouldn't be some district that would remain safe for one party or the other but the best effort would be put forth to make safe districts as competitive as possible.  2.  Geographical considerations: As an example, for the tri-county area of Ingham, Eaton and Clinton Counties: With Lansing and East Lansing being strongly Democratic leaning and the surrounding areas more Republican leaning, it would be necessary to draw district that include both city and outlying areas for the purpose of competitiveness, while observing district population requirements. I would also do my best to draw district boundaries to increase diversity within districts.  3.  Communities of Interest would be my lowest ranked priority for drawing district boundaries. My consideration for a Community of Interest would be, i.e., populations that are or most likely to be disenfranchised. They would include black, indigenous or other people of color. I would also consider populations that might include a concentration of individuals  who suffer physical or mental deficiencies.  There were many rural presenters at tonight's public comment session. Almost all gave similar requests, to keep their rural  districts intact. In many of their requests I heard, ""Keep my safe Republican district safe"". Moreover, it sounded like, ""Keep my district socially, ethnically and racially pure"". Whether I am being overly judgmental or not, their reasonings for drawing district boundaries would have no bearing on how local units of government function nor their jurisdictions. I was not convinced by any of their arguments.  I have lived in the Lansing area for 41 years. I am also a member of Voter Not Politicians, the driving force behind why each of you have been chosen to undertake the supremely important task of fairly drawing district boundaries. I am, however, from Munising, a small town in the central Upper Peninsula, home of the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore. I do have an affinity for rural populations. My only interest here however, is ensuring that every legally cast vote in Michigan is a meaningful expression of that voters voter's Constitutional right, to choose those elected servants who will represent their personal best interest."

1268,written,,dearborn city,9th state house district,I am a former candidate for state representative district 9. Doing my time running office I've walked and spoke with thousands of residents in State House district 9. One thing that was very clear to me with how silly it was for most of the district to cover the west side of Detroit which makes sense but then for three communities in the city of Dearborn to be part of the district as well. All of the residents of Dearborn are better served when they are represented by one state representative. I would like now to turn to communities of interest. I also currently work for Dearborn public schools as a special education paraprofessional. We receive students not just from the city of Dearborn but some from Dearborn heights. I think it makes sense that as you draw districts for every map that the city of Dearborn in Dearborn heights should be in the same districts.
1269,written,,se michigan ,Why Voters Voices Matter,"Since 2001 (2 gerrymanders ago), Republicans have won the popular vote for the state House 3 times (2002, 2010, and 2016), but they have won a majority of seats 8 times. ○ That means that in 5 out of the 10 elections so far this century, Michigan voters have overwhelmingly voted for Democratic candidates, but due to the Republican sleight-of-hand, the exact OPPOSITE has happened. ● Voters should be choosing their politicians, not the other way around. I strongly urge the commission to fulfill its duties in good faith to meet the ultimate goal of determining fair districting for the state legislature and U.S congressional districts. Free and fair elections are the cornerstone of a healthy democracy, and redistricting a heavily gerrymandered Michigan to accurately represent its constituents and communities, will allow our great state to truly represent the will of its people."

I live in this area, yet my state senate and congressional districts are gerrymandered in a way that I am over an hour's drive to the end points of the map as currently drawn.

My request is for this Commission to retain the Senate district comprised of Allegan and Van Buren Counties.  Van Buren and Allegan Counties have collaborated on many joint ventures for decades.  Our latest governmental joint venture is a shared Public Defender's Office which saves our taxpayers money.  Another recent venture is a shared Veterans' Treatment Court which is a great service to the troubled veterans of both counties.  We could not have offered this service to our veterans as individual counties but together we could.  Bloomingdale Communications is a small Broadband, TV, and telephone provider which serves both counties.  The Company is currently building high speed internet in the sparsely populated rural areas of both Allegan and Van Buren Counties.  Our Counties are primarily rural small town communities with similar interests.  Together we are the Blueberry Capital of Michigan and Michigan is the Blueberry Capital of the Nation.  Let's keep them in the same senate district."
1272,written,,,"Deborah Burke, Detroit",I’d like to encourage the commission to use the math models that are already out there to re-draw  the districts.

Math models will decrease conflict within the commission and increase confidence with voters. 
1273,written,,,Overcoming Division,"To the Members of the Committee,   As I suspect you are well aware, gerrymandering is deeply implicated in current partisan divisions and the fostering of toxic political discourse. When districts are ""safe"" for either party, there is no necessity for political candidates to court the other side and no incentive for compromise. The result is politicians with more extreme positions and no interest in working across the aisle. I urge you to focus in redistricting on creating to the fullest extent possible districts with politically mixed allegiances to avoid this situation. We need representatives who must think in terms of all the Michiganders they represent, not just their base; who are willing to compromise and work across the aisle; and who can be held accountable for malfeasance and untruths. To achieve this, we must work together to end gerrymandering.  Sincerely,  Jeffrey Weinstock Rosebush, MI"
1274,written,,,Michigan Redistricting,Can the redistricting Team just take the KISS approach as we do in our work environment.    It seems like it should be such a simple process to create districts that have relatively simple geometric shapes...like a rectangle...rather than districts that looks like something from a fractal geometry algorithm.  
1275,written,,,Gerrymandering concerns,"I would like there to be no gerrymandering. Districts should be as close to a square or rectangle as possible with no regard to areas with high populations of either political party, which I believe is currently more common in large cities or certain geographical areas of the state. While certain areas will have smaller geometric shapes because of dense populations, it still should be made to resemble simple shapes and not try to capture political party advantages by gerrymandering which certainly currently exists in Michigan. "
1276,written,,,Draw lines that follow obvious borders,"I would like to see lines drawn keeping cities together and drawn following major roads. For instance east of Woodward, West of Rochester Road, North of 8 mile and south of 14 mile.  Or Birmingham and Bloomfield cities.  Royal Oak and Ferndale cities.  Odd shaped districts that fail to follow existing road or city boundaries is hard to follow and divides neighborhoods, causing some citizens to feel left out.  "
1277,written,,,Keep the design simple,"After reviewing the current map of districts, I believe the best system would be to use existing county lines. This prevent cherry picking around concentration of areas, that either party may want to use to their advantage. Most people are not aware of their district may be a different one across the street, in the same county. If you must split a county in half due to population concentration, use the same distribution of the county for the added townships."
1278,written,,,Livingston County State House Districts,"The Cities of Brighton and Howell belong together: they are the relatively dense urban center of the County, defined by the Grand River Avenue corridor. More than 80% of retail stores and professional offices in the County are on or just off Grand River Avenue. The southeast part of the County is closely tied to Ann Arbor, to which many residents commute on US 23. The northwest part is as close (and sometimes closer) to both Novi and Lansing as to Ann Arbor. There is almost no farmland in the southeast, but a great deal of it in the northwest.  The urban/suburban versus rural split could not be clearer.  Because of population growth since 2010, Livingston County no longer fits in just two House districts. Nor does it need to: Unadilla and Iosco Townships are closely tied to Ingham County by the fact that residents’ children attend Stockbridge schools. With those two townships pulled out, the County splits nicely into two equal-population districts, one urban/suburban and one rural. You could call each of these a Community of Interest, I suppose, though the concept seems arbitrary and squishy to me.  I would like to attach a map that I drew using Dave's Redistricting that shows how two State House districts could be drawn to express that split.  I do not see how to do that.    "
1279,written,,,Start From a Clean Sheet,"This Commission needs to start from scratch. We know that the current maps are part of a Republican gerrymander.  How do we know that?  Because in a typical post-2006 election year, Democrats have won 47-54% of the popular vote statewide yet have never held more than 43% of the House seats.  In Livingston County, where since 2018 Democrats have won 35-43% of the county-wide vote in partisan races, they have won ZERO% of the seats.   Your job, as I see it, is to draw new maps that result in more contested districts. Safe seats are places where politicians don’t have to represent almost half of their constituents. That’s why Michiganders voted for Prop 2 – they are tired of politicians who don’t represent them. "

1282,written,,,Congress NEEDS to reflect all MI voters,"I am interested in districts that will firmly support a State congress that reflects the voters of our entire State. For example, currently, we have Democratic Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Secretary of State, and Attorney General. These races were won by a majority vote of all the voters in Michigan. However, both chambers of our State legislator have a Republican majority. These races were won within smaller districts. Thus, our State congress reflects the majority of voters in these districts, but not the State as a whole. Our State congress NEEDS to reflect the voters of the entire State. Please make this your #1 priority as you draw the new district lines. Thank you. "
1283,written,,,Sensible districts,"I am very pleased that Michigan citizens voted for an Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission, and appreciate the work the Commission will do. Thanks to the prior gerrymandering system, many Michigan congressional districts are exceedingly odd shapes in order to avoid competitive elections. I somehow kept the same congressperson when moving from Grand Rapids to the east side of Calhoun County, despite being nearly two hours away and closer to cities like Kalamazoo and Battle Creek. No District 3 congressperson has to pay the least amount of attention to anyone outside of Grand Rapids, because that's by far the population center, and the district has been safely Republican for decades. District 3 is far from the only example of this inequitable gerrymandering in Michigan, and I thank the Commission for working to correct this problem."

1285,written,,,Genesee/Oakland/Livingston County Area,"Hello Chairperson Kellom and fellow commissioners, My name is Dave Nance and I live in Fenton Township in Genesee County. I've lived in the Fenton area for 31 years. We've raised our family there.  Fenton Township and the surrounding cities and townships in the Fenton, Heartland, Holly, Linden and Grand Blanc areas are my ‘Communities of Interest’.  We've sent our kids to school there, worked and shopped there, as well as enjoyed the local community parks and facilities. These basic elements of our daily lives are central to our wellbeing. To draw district lines that separate out parts of this region wouldn’t contribute to the benefit of life in the area, it will actually tend to isolate that separated piece.  I don't believe this would be beneficial to me, my family or the other citizens of our local area. From a development sense, these areas tend to run together. When you leave the region, you're traveling into farms and countryside. This is somewhat like a boarder to the area, overall.  My description probably sounds much like that of other citizens' ‘Communities of Interest’. With that in mind, I'd like to make my next point. I believe this to be very important. That is, keeping our districts somewhat square in shape. I believe many others may think as I do. That given choices, per our means and other factors, we select an area to reside in that satisfies our needs and wants. That location is now at the center of where we want to live our lives. District mapping should reflect the inherent notion that we as citizens have ‘centered’ our lives in the midst of an overall area. Typically a location not related to some other area way off, say two or three counties away. I would most like all three of the maps to follow this same layout principal.  And so again, my ‘Communities of Interest’ that are Fenton Township, and the Cities of Fenton, Heartland, Holly, Linden and Grand Blanc are of most importance to me and my family. We would like all three of the defined districts to line up as 'one' as much as possible when they are finally determined.  Thank you for your time and dedication to integrity with respect to the redistricting project.   Have a great evening.  "

My husband grew up here and his extended family have been in the township for 55 years. My husband and I are raising 8 sons in Saginaw Township and have educated our children through the Saginaw Township Community School district.  Saginaw County is currently split between the 4th and 5th Congressional Districts. I have peers and friends through my school and church community throughout the county, and have found this division to be confusing and divisive. When I look at the current lines of our district, it does not feel like a community that I belong to - just a narrow puzzle piece of neighborhoods that happen to be adjacent on a map. Please do your best to keep the counties undivided in their districts.  Please consider Saginaw Township, the city of Saginaw and Saginaw County to be our community of interest.  I thank you for taking on this enormous, difficult task that lays before you. I see this as an opportunity to simmer the divisive culture that exists in our political sphere at this time. Thank you for doing your best to serve the interests of all. "

For the past 34 years I have resided in Saginaw Township in Saginaw County. As a Michigan citizen, I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in this public meeting regarding the redistricting process. Thank you, Chair of the Commission, Brittni Kellogg, and all of you who are giving time and effort as members of this commission. It is a significant task you have been assigned, and I pray you will be successful in accomplishing it with integrity, skill, and timeliness. I am a resident of Saginaw County, which is split between the 4th and 5th US Congressional Districts. This is very confusing and cumbersome when it comes to elections, both for candidates and voters. Please try to keep our counties across the state undivided. My husband and I have raised 7 sons in Saginaw Township, including our youngest who is a special-needs young adult. His schooling and special services are all centered within Saginaw County and fall within the Saginaw Intermediate School District. Here in Saginaw Township, we are blessed to have a wide variety of ethnic backgrounds represented in the homes on our street. What binds us together most of all is our physical proximity in our neighborhood. We are neighbors, and our neighbors are our friends. Our church is local, within our community. Our work in the field of medical care is local, within our city. Our schools are important to us. Please, PLEASE, consider our Saginaw Township, city of Saginaw, and Saginaw County to be our ""Communities of Interest."" Please make the geographical boundaries concise and compact. Please help us to have strong, cohesive neighborhoods and communities so we can have a stronger, more productive state for our families. Thank you. "
1288,written,,,Testimony to the MICRC,"Dear Chair Kellom and members of the Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission:  My name is David Robertson, 5511 Wakefield Rd., Grand Blanc, Michigan, 48439. I am a lifelong resident of Genesee County and have lived in Grand Blanc Township for the past 33 years. I currently serve as Clerk for the Charter Township of Grand Blanc.  I appreciate the opportunity to offer my testimony to this Commission. I want to thank you for efforts on behalf of the people of the State of Michigan. I share your goal of creating a fair, legal and constitutional redistricting plan at both the state and federal level.  Having spent my entire life in Genesee County, there can be no question that for me, Genesee County in general, and Grand Blanc Township in particular, is my community of interest. I encourage you to view them similarly. As a Commission you have been charged with defining “community of interest”. I believe a proper definition must include a respect for county, city and township boundaries. While the crossing of municipal boundaries is part of the process to be sure, it should be kept to a minimum. The charge this Commission has been given by the Michigan Constitution requires an emphasis be placed upon geographic contiguity and compactness along with and with your definition of community of interest.  Simply put, the legislative and congressional maps should appeal to common sense in the way in which they are drawn.   As Township Clerk, charged by statute with the proper administration of elections, I simply wish to remind the Chair and members that with each municipal and county boundary crossed, brings increased complexity, increased potential for human error, and increased cost to Michigan taxpayers.   Again, I want to thank you, Chair Kellom, and the other Commission members for your work on the Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission. I have every confidence you will succeed in your task of bringing about a fair, legal and constitutional redistricting plan for the people of our Great State of Michigan.  Respectfully submitted,  David B. Robertson Grand Blanc Township Clerk "

I live near Brighton, in Green Oak Township in Livingston County, and I truly appreciate the time you are putting into this important endeavor.  Rather than relying on old legislative maps, I urge you to start fresh and redraw new districts from scratch. This will ensure that elected officials better reflect the will of their constituents, and result in more fair representation of residents, and the various communities of interest, throughout the state.  Livingston County is one of the fastest growing counties in the state, and we have both rural and urban communities of interest. The Grand River corridor, which follows I-96, is one important community of interest that connects Brighton and Howell from the more rural areas of the county. U.S. 23 is another community of interest that ties Brighton and Hartland with Ann Arbor. These urban areas have much more in common than they do with the rural areas and I believe they should be kept together.  Thank you for soliciting input through public hearings. I strongly support the redrawing of district maps that are fair and competitive, and that all the views of all voters to be fully represented.  Best regards, Janice Karlovich Brighton, MI 48116 "
1290,written,,"livingston,marion township",Kasey Helton Redistricting Comments,"I Live in Michigan’s 47’s house district currently. I believe that we need to start from scratch completely with our district lines, which includes rural areas like mine. I believe if we retain some of the current structure, then we will have a built-in bias from previous gerrymandered districts, which will counteract all of the goals that citizen lead redistricting is trying to reach. The primary goal is of course having voters choose their politicians and not the other way around.  Evidence that these biases exist are shown in the fact that one party won the popular vote in 2020 but did not win the majority of seats. If we keep the foundations of the old lines intact, Then we will continue to see this pattern regardless of who has the majority in Lansing.   We must begin to make our districts more competitive so that voters who live in districts like mine are not ignored. Right now gerrymandering has created a tailor-made district Design to disqualify my concerns as a citizen. These types of districts exist all over the map for both political parties and that’s what we need to eliminate.   Specifically for my district, One community of interest to keep in mind for the 47th and it’s counterpart, the 42nd, Is to combine the entire Grand River business corridor in Livingston County into one district. The map currently divides this very significant place where people shop, run businesses, go to schools, go to work, into two divided districts. As it currently stands, If you want to travel from east to west in my county, Grand River is the road you take. It makes no sense to have this area divided into two congressional districts when they have so much in common from a business and community standpoint.   Thank you.  "
1291,written,,upper peninsula,UP redistricting,"Hello Commissioners: I attended the public hearing in Marquette on May 18th. As one of the local citizens involved in getting Proposal 2 passed in 2018, I completely understand the importance of citizen input to the redistricting process. After listening and learning a variety of perspectives at the public hearing, I now advocate that the districts be drawn to reflect the east-west major highways and the lakeshore communities of the Great Lakes.  The attached map (which has already been submitted by one of my peers) sums up my input quite well:  For starters, Powell Township and Ishpeming Township (both in Marquette County) definitely need to be ""drawn back"" into our community, which is Marquette County. This was a major theme at the public hearing as you will recall and is very logical. Additionally, it makes sense to me to keep Lake-Superior-bordering areas together, Lake-Michigan-bordering areas together, and then let the far western Upper Peninsula be banded together. I agree that Marquette, Alger and Baraga are a community of interest and that the citizenry belong together as much as possible.     Below is the map. I hope that including it here in the Testimony will suffice. If not, please contact me.  https://districtr.org/plan/22360"

1293,written,,,"Unbiased, competitive districts are BEST","The heart of our union and the basis of what makes up our representative democracy is the voice of the people. All voting districts should not favor any single party in any way. The competition within unbiased districts is what creates fair elections and is required by law within our U.S. Constitution. To do anything other than creating equally competitive district lines destroys the basis of the United States Representative Democratic Republic. Gerrymandering is an illegal procedure as it goes against the will of the people and the constitutional right of ""Fair"" elections. Having unbiased districts also forces the political parties to once again listen to the people they represent and NOT JUST the MONEY they get from their wealthy and corporate donors. If we want to avoid our wonderful country from sliding into an oligarchy of wealthy rulers we MUST continue the founding fathers constitutional right of forcing the countries leaders to submit to the will of the people and that can only be done if the elections are done with fair district lines which will hold politicians accountable to their true stakeholders the actual voting public!  Money will not be removed from politics BUT fairly drawn districts force candidates to care about what the public they represent actually THINK and that is what separates the United States from other failed Democracies!! I sure hope that the Commission members will do their BEST to create FAIR and unbiased districts that give the people of Michigan a TRUE VOICE in our government because anything less is tyranny! "

No party, regardless if you support one or the other, should have more power by essentially cheating their way to victory.

1297,written,,lansing,Demand map,"I’ve lived in midmichigan all my life.   Lansing Mall (Delta township) and meridian mall (Meridian Township) were part of Lansing for us.  I think when you consider the other factors of BWL service, CATA service, major roads connecting the two townships east and west and the major roads in Lansing going south to connect Delhi township, the following communities should be kept together for a state senate district and a congressional district:  Lansing, East Lansing, and Meridian, Delta and Delhi townships.  This is one large city really.  The immediate surrounding townships (DeWitt, Williamstown, Aurelius) are quite rural - no city water, we have wells, in fact Williamston city has its own water system.  The outer townships of Ingham and Eaton counties are nothing like the community I delineated above. As far as a congressional boundary, the current 8th district where suburban areas of Oakland and my suggestion for Lansing’s cohesive community of interest are represented together has been shocking for two decades now.  No one can say Rochester and Waverly (Delta township) are similar as suburbs.  Thank you for your consideration."

Most of us here live on acre+ lots in the country. Many of us commute to other cities for work, but commute home because we prefer living in the country instead of the city. We pay lower taxes. We prefer smaller communities. Many of us own firearms, hunt, and fish. Some of us here own farms. We organize with the small towns in our county for community events. Brighton, Howell, Pinckney, Fowlerville, Hartland, and Hamburg.  We have different values than Washtenaw County's Ann Arbor or Ingham County's East Lansing/Lansing.  Residents in Washtenaw County said at a previous meeting that they did not want to be with a district in Brighton (current St Senate district - which broke a long tradition). Today, a resident in Lansing said he didn't want to be in a district with Brighton (Current congressional district). I live by Brighton and I agree with those residents - we should be in a district with other similar like minded rural communities - not Lansing or Ann Arbor.

1302,written,,,Joshua Pugh testimony on Lansing region,"Madam Chair, members of the commission, thank you for your service to our state and for your commitment to throwing out the old gerrymanders and drawing new maps from scratch. My name is Joshua Pugh and I was born just a couple blocks from here at Sparrow Hospital, and now live in Lansing’s Walnut Neighborhood. My community of interest is the metro Lansing region, irrespective of county lines. Through an accident of geography, Lansing sits in the far northwest corner of Ingham County. Because of this, for at least the last seventy years, the residents of this region have had their votes unfairly diluted, as Clinton County and Eaton County residents have been carved into outstate districts, despite living just three miles north or two miles west of where we currently sit in downtown Lansing. Despite living and working in one of the most dense and diverse regions of the state, many of my neighbors are represented in Congress by rural residents like John Moolenaar and Tim Walberg.  Residents of Lansing’s inner-ring suburbs like DeWitt, Grand Ledge, and Bath, have far more in common with each other than with folks who live in Vermontville, Olivet, St Johns, and Laingsburg. In addition to living in very similar communities, we work, grocery shop, recreate, and worship in the same places.   Please keep Lansing’s inner-ring suburbs together instead of dividing us along arbitrary county boundaries that dilute our votes. Michigan’s county lines regularly changed throughout the 19th century. There’s no good nonpartisan reason to use them now to guide our legislative districts in this region, when they don’t actually reflect the way we organize ourselves. Thank you. "

Parking is easy and free; plus we know many of the farmers.  I could live anywhere I want, and I did move to a city for a few years.  When I had a chance, I moved back to Windsor Township.

In pursuit of that fairness, I have a few thoughts. The first thing that screams unfair and unreasonable to me is weird, twisting district shapes. Please make the shapes reasonable and squared as much as possible. Second on the list of unfairness is change for no particular or for arbitrary reasons. Changes to format, especially significant ones, should have logical, non-partisan, easily explainable reasons behind them. Lastly, people often have their identity and history tied into their city, county, township, or other municipality. Please make every effort to keep these lines intact with the drawing of the districts. I appreciate your consideration."

I have never known a congressman who is so opposite to my views and values and those of many of my friends and neighbors in the district. As someone with longstanding close ties to my community, it astounds us all that Ann Arbor is explicitly severed from the rest of the County as the district is currently drawn.  As a result our community is not represented adequately.  It is a widely shared belief that without a gerrymandered district, Mr. Walberg could not hold a popular majority. It is my view that Washtenaw County in particular would be better served with a district boundary that includes the entire county.  Thank you.  Steve Burdick 8857 Webster Hills Rd Dexter MI 48130 "

We each grew up in different but neighboring rural townships, within Clinton County. My husband on a crop farm, and I on a dairy farm. In addition, we chose to raise our 7 children in yet another rural township of Clinton County, from where we have homeschooled our 7 children for almost 30 years. In every township where we have lived within Clinton County, we have discovered common, positive qualities. In our 64 years of experiences within Clinton County, we have encountered many, many people with whom we share the same values and belief systems. We have appreciated the opportunities that have come from living near other homeschool families with whom we have played sports and studied music and academics. The land offers lakes, rivers, creeks, fields, woods, parks, trails, spacious areas to explore, small towns, and family-friendly communities, where people can pass on their faith and their freedoms to their children and grandchildren. It is a place where we can freely grow, do business, build communities, and thrive, as well as minister to one another as we develop our God-given gifts and abilities. As you consider the border lines of our districts, I would ask that you keep the districts square, compact, and the population equal.

I also grew up on a farm. I went to the University of Michigan and lived in Ann Arbor so I have some understanding  of the   difference between city and country life. The focus of life is different in the country with farmers meeting for breakfast in local restaurants (before the pandemic) to informally discuss farming and local interests before going out to do daily work. Development of the land is  looked on with skepticism because it brings the possible loss of farmland and way of life. In the last few years local people have  organized and kept several different developments out of the area. We need to keep farmland intact for the nation's food supply. On the other hand, in cities such as Ann Arbor research, development, and expansion are the focus.  In the Michigan counties running along  the border of Ohio and Indiana each county has its own county fair showcasing livestock and crafts of 4H children and food, etc. Each county is very proud of their individual fairs with friendly competition between them. Washtenaw County does not have  a county fair, only festivals in different towns. I would like to see each county have its own State Representative since the State Representative spends a lot of time at the county fair talking to constituents of that county. I would like to see our State Senator's area cover a farming area so we could be sure our interests would be paramount. In the same vein, I would like  to see the Congressman's area also cover farm communities across the district. This is my community of interest. Thank you for hearing my point of view.

For fifty years, I have lived in three of the four parts of Ottawa County, one pf the 10 most populous counties in Michigan located west of Grand Rapids along the shore of Lake Michigan.  Currently I live and vote in Hudsonville. For five decades, I have seen Ottawa County treated both as one community of interest and multiple communities of interest for drawing of congressional and state legislative boundaries.  In terms of personal background, I did not grow up in Ottawa County and my family is racially mixed.   The current situation of keeping the county together has provided us the most effective representation in Lansing and Washington, D. C.  While our population concentration is at four corners, our current representation in the form of three state representatives, one state senator, and half of a Congressional District helps hold us together and enables Ottawa County governmental entities to serve our citizens well.  My personal interest is to keep Ottawa County prosperous and growing over the next ten years.  This starts with having its views well represented in Lansing and Washington, D.C. and having easy to understand district boundaries as citizens choose and interact with their representatives.    I want to maintain Ottawa County and its communities to include Holland, Jenison, Grand Haven, Hudsonville, Coopersville, Zeeland, Spring Lake, and Allendale as an attractive an opportunity as they were for my family.

A point that I failed to mention at that meeting was that a lot of speakers from Midland spoke about the flood from 2020 and how it affected them but that those downstream have dealt with the consequences of poor decision of Midland County for over a century in the form of pollution disposal. So currently while Midland is separated from Bay City and Saginaw politically, and the locals want it to stay that way, I'll get to that soon,  their recklessness and ability to pay off specific offices to keep quiet has led to damage throughout the Great Lakes Bay Region and the region. What Midland dumps, Midland doesn't have to deal with. Saginaw and Bay City do.  As for the reason why Midland wants to stay the same I want to point out current representation of the region in the State House and State Senate. As I stated MI House #98 encompasses the sparsely populated Northern and Western parts of Bay County but gets the entirety of Midland City. External parts of Midland County have the benefit of MI House #99 to also get representation as they have enough power to pull representation from Mount Pleasant, the only other midsize municipality in that district. Northern Bay County is more in line with Standish and Gladwin than Midland City. It always has been.   Saginaw county is even more egregious. This county was specifically packed together the higher level of minority citizens and democratic citizens by putting Zilwaukee, Buena Vista Township, and Bridgeport Township in with the City of Saginaw in MI House #95 but wrap the rest of the county in MI House #94 even though voters in Saginaw Township, Thomas Township, and Tittabawassee Township, are more directly affected by the region to Saginaw directly than to Frankenmuth and Birch Run on the opposite side of the County. This was deliberate.   As I mentioned on Tuesday the Michigan State Senate map for Bay County is intentionally breaking up the region to better position one party in our region. Please work at combining parts of Bay, Saginaw, and Midland as population limits allow for better representation.  Thank You  Alex Dewitt Bay City Founder-Get Accountable Bay City"

I grew up in Chicago, moved to East Lansing (EL) for school, and lived, worked & raised a family there for over 30 yrs. Our extended family resides in and has deep historic ties to Clinton County.  I personally know and understand the urban versus rural needs for community representation to address these very different communities’ priorities.   Bath is unique due to a tragic school bombing that killed ~ 40 children and shook the community to its core.  Bath is so closely tied to that tragic bombing that the Memorial Museum resides in its Middle School in order that those children will never be forgotten.  Very few others than those from Bath, know about and understand the significance of this to our rural community. We live on farmland directly across from that murderer’s property.   Bath is also unique due to its border with the East Lansing/MSU community.  When East Lansing annexed the area north on Abbott /Chandler Rd, high density student housing filled the space of a turf farm & small airport. An agreement to have that area vote as part of Bath Township but be owned by EL was arranged.  This dramatically & quickly changed the Township due to a high population of transient national election voters, that are not concerned with rural/small town living and its issues.    I am asking that the 4th District plan encompasses all of Clinton County and similar communities to preserve the historical ties, and the like-minded values and needs versus those of metropolitan areas.  These are sound legitimate reasons to have the people in rural & small town communities such as in Bath Township, Clinton County, be kept together.  Thank you for your time and dedication to an honest, well thought out process to not disrupt our current community ties.   "
1317,written,,,Tri-County Community of Interest,"May 26, 2021  To the members of the commission:  I join with a number of others from the Ingham-Eaton-Clinton county area to encourage you to consider the three counties as a comunity of interest in drawing Michigan's congressional and legislative districts.  It is particularly important the three counties be combined into one congressional district in order to better represent the interests and reflect the concerns of the region.  The three counties are now split between three congressional districts which diminishes their overall effect and influence on national and state policy.    The region has an overall population of more than 400,000 people, not large enough on its own to contain a single congressional district.  But it is approxiametely the third largest metro region in Michigan.  It is home to the state Capitol, one of the 100 finest universities in the world, major industries -- including manufacturing, insurance, agriculture, healthcare, and others -- as well as internationally critical scientific research, especially with the upcoming opening of  the Facility for Rare Isotope research at Michigan State University.  It has an active arts and culutre structure, major athletic events, and other entertainment which draws thousands upon thousands of tourists as well as residents.    And the region recognizes itself as a unique tri-county area.  The news agencies covering the region cover all three counties.  Residents routinely cross county lines from their homes to their work to their entertainment. The City of Lansing's boundaries are in both Ingham and Eaton counties..  The City of East Lansing's boudnaries are in both Ingham and Clinton counties.     A small list of private and public organizations that views themselves serving the tri-county region include:  Public Agencies  Capital Area Transportation Authority  Community Mental Health Authority of Clinton, Eaton, Ingham Counties   State of Michigan Prosperity Region [Health and Human Services, Economic Development, Education, Agriculture and Rural Development, Natural Resources, etc.]   Tri County Office on Aging  Tri-County Metro Narcotics Squad  Tri-County Regional Planning Commission [Planning; environmental quality; transportation; community and economic development; data and mapping]   US Census: Metropolitan Statistical Area  Nonprofits   Capital Area Community Services [Clinton, Eaton, Ingham, and Shiawassee]   Capital Area Health Alliance  Capital Area Humane Society   Capital Area Michigan Works   Capital Area United Way   Capital Region Community Foundation   Capital Region Small Business Development Center   Disability Network Capital Area [Clinton, Eaton, Ingham, and Shiawassee]   Lansing Capital Area Salvation Army   Lansing Economic Area Partnership [LEAP]   RSVP of Ingham, Eaton, & Clinton Counties [Volunteer service program]   Tri-County Alliance for Public Education  Tri-County Bicycle Association  Tri-County Crisis Intervention Team  Tri-County TRIAD [Promotes older adult safety and reduces the fear of crime]  Businesses   Ace Cleaning and Restoration: Service the Lansing and the Tri-County Area   Ramsey Civil Process Service, Inc.   Tri County Community Advocates   Tri County Home Improvements   Tri- County Maintenance  Tri-County Emergency Medical Control Authority   Tri-County Guardianship Services   Tri-County Mobile Veterinary Clinic   Tri-County Plumbing and Drain Cleaning Inc   Tri-County Realty  But split into three congressional districts, the region is overwhelmed by the concerns of often more rural regions.  Those concerns are certainly critical, but so too are the business, transportation, education, healthcare, social justice and equity, housing and government services issues of the tric-county region where the population of all three counties is largely concentrated around Lansing.  I hope you take into serious consideration making the Ingham-Eaton-Clinton area a part of congressional district as you draw the maps for the 2022-2030 elections.  Thank you,  John Lindstrom "
1318,written,,,Respect the Saginaw-Midland-Bay City CSA,"Comments by Fred Thomas (#33) to the MICHIGAN INDEPENDENT CITIZENS REDISTRICTING COMMISSION Midland, May 25, 2021  First, I want to thank the Commission for your important and difficult work. I am Fred Thomas, a retired physics professor. I’m a little unique among the people here in not being a long-time resident. Two and a half years ago, my wife and I moved to this area. We live in Freeland in Saginaw County, but Freeland is at the center of the small triangle formed by the cities of Saginaw, Midland and Bay City, equidistance from each. We picked Freeland partly because we felt we needed access to all three cities for different aspects of the life we wanted. To us, the best results for this area have been achieved when people took a non-partisan, Tri-County approach, for example building an airport and establishing a community college district, both of which treat Midland, Bay and Saginaw Counties as a single community. Some people here have talked about the Tittabawassee flood as uniting Midland with its northern neighbors, but the flooding, the long-standing pollution and the recreational opportunities also flow downstream, uniting Midland with Saginaw and Bay Counties. Another non-partisan group, the Federal Office of Management and Budget, recognizes Saginaw, Midland and Bay Counties as a Combined Statistical Area (CSA) because the three counties have a high degree of social and economic integration. Partisan political maneuvering, on the other hand, has split our three-county community along intricate, twisting boundaries for Congress and the State House. A quick look at these current boundaries shows them to be one of the most blatant examples of gerrymandering found anywhere in Michigan or the US. I ask this Commission to be truly objective and non-partisan and to recognize that the Tri-Counties ought to be unified politically."
1319,written,,,"COI for Midland, MI","Midland, MI has undergone a lot of trauma in the past year, given the devastating flood and the pandemic.  Although the entire country shares the pandemic trauma to varying degrees, when the devastating flood is added on top, it is a considerable challenge. That has led me to the idea of a COI around the watershed of the Tittabawassee River, which flows into the Saginaw River and then into Saginaw Bay at Bay City. This COI would then also include Saginaw and Bay City--which have, with Midland--formed the Tri-Cities for many decades, so another aspect of this COI. One could also envision that this COI might even include Genesee County as part of an urban COI, linked by the  auto industry and many shared interests in the arts. Currently the 4th US Congressional District including Midland is the same one that includes northern, rural counties all the way up to Mackinaw Straits.  This is not a good combination, as the representatives seem to focus only on rural issues and not urban ones. Combining the Tri-Cities into a single COI, at a minimum but possibly also with Genesee County, would provide a more cohesive COI with shared concerns and shared challenges that could be addressed by the representatives elected to serve this COI."
1320,written,,,County Lines?,I think an easy and simple solution would be to align the districts to match up with the already in place county lines.

1322,written,,"clinton county,lansing",Lansing Center Meeting 5/27/21,"As a resident of Clinton County Congressional District #4, I would like to submit my comments to you concerning district boundary lines.  I live in a county that is full of diverse-looking people but we have something in common that we do not have in common with people in Ingham and Eaton County. We have Clinton County values.  We believe in self-reliance. We can take care of things ourselves without the help of the government. There are many small business owners spread across Clinton County. We work hard for what we have. We provide jobs with real wages. We pay taxes. We own our own homes. We take care of those who are less fortunate by volunteering at many of our social programs. We assist people to help those who need a hand up and take pride in knowing the difference between a hand up and a handout.  We have a community that is made up of different types of people. Some are rural, some live in subdivisions, some in apartments, and many in their own homes. Our community comes together in times of need to help people through Go Fund Me or like events.   We support our police and believe in strong courts and public safety.   These traits of Clinton County are not shared with the counties to the south of us. Our county government is well run with the lowest property taxes in the area and no debt. Our county is strong financially with the Pension and OPEB funds over 100% fully funded. Our county neighbors to the south are millions of dollars in debt. The people in Clinton County would not allow local government officials to spend so much more than we can afford.  Our schools are different. During the pandemic, our parents made sure kids attended school either virtual or online. The Lansing State Journal has reported that kids in our southern neighboring counties were vastly absent from attending either virtual or in-person training. This is not accepted in Clinton County.  Our employment rate is very high in Clinton County and reliance on government social programs is low compared to our neighbors to the south.  It is not arrogance to say you live in Clinton County. It is pride. There is a reason why so many people work in other counties but choose to live in Clinton County. We are in the middle of a housing boom while our neighbors to the south are seeing single-family homes being sold and turned into rental properties with many of them low-income housing.  Clinton County is a destination and not a place people are trying to flee.   Please research these facts and you will find that Clinton County is not a Community of Interest with any of the counties to the south.  Respectfully, Kenneth B. Mitchell 15725 Grove Rd. Lansing, MI 48906 "
1323,written,,,Incompatible criteria,"I have spent many hours over the past several weeks trying to draw a State House districting plan that meets all the various criteria, above all that provides proportionality in political representation.  What I am finding rapidly is that due to the highly divided residential patterns between rural republicans and urban democrats and minorities, is that in order to draw proportional districts including minority representation one must violate compactness  and splitting criteria in a big way.  I.E. simultaneous maximization of the various criteria seems to require putting some criteria to the side in a big way. What is the commission's plan to deal with this? "
1324,written,,,Fair Districts = Fair Elections,"I live in the very gerrymandered MI-9 district, which was created to keep the Levin family (Sander, and now his boy Andy) a safe, secure, and permanent career. Since this district was served up on a silver platter to the Levin family, there is no chance for there ever to be a fair election in this district. THIS IS WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE! Redraw the district to be fair, so that someone like Andy Levin CANNOT take his job and the voters for granted, knowing that no matter what, his job is secure, and his elections are always won. Give us FAIR DISTRICTS so that we can have FAIR ELECTIONS!"
1325,written,,,Caleb’s Midland County Testimony,"(Originally presented in person at the Redistricting Public Forum, Midland,MI 5/25/2021.) My name is Caleb Hortop. I live in Homer Township just outside the Midland City limits in Midland County.  My wife and I chose to buy our first home here because we valued access to a small city with rural surroundings.    I grew up in neighboring Gladwin County which was the southernmost county in the former 1st district for much of my childhood, where we rarely saw anything from our federal representation. This made it difficult to civically engage until the current 4th district lines were drawn, uniting Gladwin and Midland Counties.  As a kid, we would go to Midland for shopping, recreation, and field trips.  Our commerce, social lives, and community needs were and remain interconnected.  I can attest first hand that Midland has shared interests with counties like Gladwin, Clare, Isabella, and Gratiot.  It has meant a great deal to my family and friends in Gladwin and Midland alike to have representation from a shared community of interests in times of disaster, need, and fellowship.    Keeping Midland County united with our equally and more sparsely populated neighbors under the news maps is compliant with new rules and the right thing to do.  Thank you for your consideration. "
1326,written,,,Midland Small Businesses,"Statement for MICRC Public Comment Portal 5/25/21 – Midland Julie Carey, 6021 Emerson Court, Midland, MI  48640 (989 600 3817)    Good evening.  My name is Julie Carey.  I live in the city of Midland.  In the current Fourth Congressional District almost 95 percent of the jobs are created by small business owners. These are the mom and pop shops that provide employment in our downtowns and main streets. Living in Midland for about 40 years with a history of several small family owned businesses in Midland and Clare, we, the small business owners, are a community of interest.    Reviewing today’s current maps, it makes sense to keep Midland County with the counties of mid and northern Michigan because we share in the same interests.  We   recognize that it is small business owners that provide the jobs in our rural communities. I would ask the Commission when updating our district lines, that you keep Midland County whole and with counties that share similar interests.  It also makes sense to me to limit the number of breaks in municipalities.   Just like a business doesn’t want a break in its supply chain, I think the same can be said for drawing district lines.  Splitting up counties, and township lines, will only add delays and confusion for residents -  be that delays in them getting the resources they need or trying to vote.  Thank you for your time and the opportunity to be heard. "
1327,written,,,School districts as ICRC building blocks,"I presented to the MICRC's first public hearing in Jackson.  As a past president of the Ann Arbor Public Schools Board of Education, I know there is no issue more important to voters than the education of their children.  As much as possible school districts should not be broken up by the MICRC's new maps.  I urge the Commission to use school districts as the building blocks for its maps."
1328,written,,,Splitting Townships,"I know you have a big job ahead of you.  I program the elections for Gratiot County, and if you could please not split townships or cities for any of these offices.  Emerson Township right now has 11 people that have House 90, the rest of the township is House 73 and it causes a split in the ballots, they have 6 ballot styles, some being schools, which we can't change, but to have to generate 25 ballots for 11 voters, and get a test Deck that cost $100.00 for each ballot style, for each election.  It gets expensive when you split townships.  So, please, keep townships and cities across the board whole--  Thank you for your time. Angie Thompson"
1329,written,,,Keep Midland County whole,"Good evening. My name is Amanda Oster_  and I live in the village of Sanford in Midland County. Last year’s devastating dam failures and subsequent floods are no better example of why Midland County needs to remain whole in the redistricting process.  When the dams failed it was a nightmare come true. To hear sirens blaring and having our first responders going through the community telling us the dams had failed and we had to evacuate immediately on loudspeakers was so frightening. I am a prior 911 dispatcher so I know this was no easy task. Being on the other end of the line opened my eyes even more to what our first responders do. I witnessed agencies working together as they had trained to do, to ensure that not one life was spared. Not one. It took the county with its leadership and resources working as one to get residents emergency information to stay safe, to help in the clean up process and now in the recovery effort. As an entire county, we were able to request state and federal dollars and work as one to get the resources we needed when we needed them.  Midland county is my community of interest and keeping Midland County whole is in the best interest of this community.  "
1330,written,,,Why competitive elections are important.,Gerrymandered districts lead to hyper-partisan elections with politicians who ignore a large part of their constituency as they pander to their base.  This leads to dysfunction in government that's so purpose is to serve the well being of the people they serve.  Balanced districts will lead to civil discord to solve the concerns of the constituents.  I live in a district like this and for all intensive purposes my family's interests and well being are ignored.  It is long past due to correct this untenable situation.  I am excited about the Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission and appreciate your willingness to serve.

1333,written,,,MBS Senate district,"Hello MICRC, I have lived in Midland County for the last 17 years.  I believe that the county of Midland should be aligned with Saginaw and Bay counties. We share industrial, educational and recreational interests with both Bay City and Saginaw. When I leave my community to seek other services, I head to either Bay City or Saginaw. I do not head either west or north. When the dam failed I had to look up on a map where the dam was, because I had no idea where it was. We had to work with those counties to rebuild AND the Bay and Saginaw counties TOO, because they were also flooded. We are known as the tri-cities.  We share the MBS airport (Midland, Bay City Saginaw). We ARE the Great Lakes Bay Region. That is how we should be represented in the state and federal governments. Frankly, I was very surprised when I looked at how the districts were drawn. I appreciate the daunting task in front of you. Please remember that this committee was formed to remove gerrymandering and to provide fair districts for the voters of Michigan."
1334,written,,,Midland County Schools,"Good evening. My name is Bill G. Schuette and I appreciate this opportunity to speak before the commission.  I believe very strongly that Midland County and the greater Midland area is a community of interest that should be represented at the federal and state levels. There are many aspects that tie our community together but what I’d like to highlight for the commission is how our education system and schools are an important aspect that connects the area and forms the fabric of our local society.  Midland County is blessed to have a number of top performing K-12 public school districts, private schools that provide religious educational opportunities, colleges, universities and vocational training schools. These schools not only prepare the young people in our county for success through teaching and study, but also provide opportunities for social engagement and extracurricular activities.   I attended Midland Public Schools from Kindergarten through High School. The education I received helped prepare me for a career working as an Intelligence Officer for the Department of Defense. But being a part of this school system introduced me to friends and built relationships I maintain to this day. I rode the bus to school with kids from all different neighborhoods, played sports with and against classmates from across the county and got the chance to volunteer in community service projects via school-sponsored clubs. By virtue of time in our county’s education system, I learned what I needed to perform professionally but also developed lasting community ties that drew me back home.  I recently moved back to Midland after working for the Defense Intelligence Agency. One reason that I am so enthusiastic about being back home is because we have a gem in our local county schools. A system like this deserves to be preserved and that can best happen if we maintain our current representative districts and its status as a community of interest represented in state and federal government.   #Midland "

Rodney Wakeman, R-Saginaw Township.  As a retired journalist serving Central Michigan, I have also been involved in many community and political activities in the same area. Long story short, the current 94th State Representative District will forever be served by a Republican Party candidate unless the district is redistricted fairly. It has been carved into a district encompassing Republican Party strong holds as Frankenmuth, Tittabawassee and Thomas townships via previous redistricting efforts. A Democratic or Independent candidate does not realistically stand  a chance. Republican Kingpins have long known this and thus shift their campaign dollars and workers elsewhere. As a former lifetime Republican (now Independent), I have witnessed this firsthand as a campaign worker in this district. It would take a political scandal of enormous magnitude to shake the timbers in this district - certainly not we want or deserve in a real Democracy! Bob Grnak. "

I would ask the commission to please leave Midland County in tact, and leave us aligned with the agricultural communities to the north. While Midland County is neighbors with Bay, Saginaw and Genesee, we are extremely different. Midland County is different from these neighboring counties with regard to household income, educational achievement, tax base, and crime rate, among others. We have very different challenges. Again, Please leave Midland County aligned with other rural communities to the north with which we are already aligned,  including Gladwin County.

1337,written,,,The Greater Midland Community,"On behalf of the City of Midland and as the City Clerk, believe it imperative that the City remain located within the same Congressional and Legislative Districts as all other Midland County cities and townships following this redistricting effort. In short, Midland County and our Community should not be bisected or split into multiple political jurisdictions due to the potential for competing legal and political ramifications that would derail safety and economic improvements along the Tittabawassee River watershed.  The May 2020 dam failure and subsequent catastrophic flooding event created the need for a county-wide emergency response, much of which required a cohesive request for support from State and Federal resources and disaster assistance. At this time, the future of the Tittabawassee River watershed and its corresponding dam system in Midland County remains to be determined; however, even after a decision about the future of this system is made, the potential implications of another disaster similar in magnitude to the May 2020 event would require an expedited, uniform response. Redistricting jurisdictions and separating those whom must work together to secure resources and funding in emergency situations will prove problematic to our goal of delivering a response quickly, safely, and fairly to our County-wide community.  The ability to have a unified voice for our Midland Community to represent the entire county at State and Federal levels is tantamount to ensuring that all Midland County residents, whether they live within the City of Midland, Sanford, Coleman, or a neighboring township, are fairly and equitably represented at our State and Federal levels of government.

My wife, Olivia, and I are raising our nearly two-year-old son Andrew and are expecting our second son on June 25th. Like many other young couples, we made an intentional decision to live in Midland and to raise our family here as part of the larger Tittabawassee River community. We believe our community has a lot to offer young families including great school districts, parks, small town values, the opportunity to explore the outdoors and our rivers and to learn about agriculture and many different industries. Our community is not just the city of Midland or the village of Sanford, but also the many other communities on the banks of our rivers and lakes connected by the Tittabawassee. My wife and I do not want to see our community sliced up into multiple congressional and state senate districts and merged with metropolitan centers. We worry that if our small town is lumped in with large metropolitan communities that our needs, our values, our way of life will take a back seat to theirs.   The challenges of this past year (Covid, the resulting economic uncertainty, the closure of many of our local businesses, and the historic floods caused by dam failures) have scarred the collective psyche of our community. But through it all I watched our family, friends, and neighbors come together in unbelievable ways to help each other through some of the most difficult times in the history of this region. Our shared sense of loss and our united spirit to recover and rebuild has only reinforced our community’s identity. I think it would be a shame to break this community apart. Please keep Midland together in one congressional district as splitting it up will only hinder our efforts to recover what we have lost. "

What I mean is programs, offices, and agencies have all been aligned based on demographics to create service areas already.

I am a single mother of two, I am currently going to school for my doctorate in Naturopathy athe Naturopathic Institute of Therapies and Education, I also coach soccer for elementary school students.   I want to take the time to explain how I know that there are inacuracies in the Census 2020 in Michigan. I know for a fact that the population is off by three because I never submitted or reported myself or my children online or with and individual.   During 2020, the pandemic, and quarantine I worked two part time jobs to support myself and my children totalling 50-60 hours a week.   I lost two of those jobs, be ause they were deemed non-essential or they lost work due to the shut downs. I dealt with loss of family, friends, the dissolution of my marriage. My priority last year were the safety and security of myself, my children, and our future.   I am here today to continue to provide that future for my children.   The committee today is comprised of republicans, democrats, and independents to try to formulate the fairest redistricting for those who were able to complete their census information. I am here to tell you that along with myself thousands of other united states citizen's will not be accounted for.   You are responsible to find out what the true numbers are, and carry the mindfulness that you are also responsible to the constituents who were unaccounted for during these unprecedented times in human history.   I ask for common sense when maintaining or changing the statuses of our locations. I ask that you specifically reach out to the proposed areas in printed media, as well as online media platforms to allow everyone the opportunity to understand what is going on and how they will be effected. This also coincides with Americans with disabilities act as well as the Michigan Freedom of information act.

We are a rural area, not urban, and we need to stay connected with the rural counties such as: -Midland, -Clare, & -Gladwin.   Rural districts are at risk of being put into urban districts, and I am asking that you prevent this.  The current district lines, they make sense. We just need to update them according to the population , and keep our naturally drawn county lines.   Thank you for your time, and patience. "
1345,written,,,Redistricting and the Environment,"Members of the Commission, My name is Terry Miller. I taught for 30 years in the Saginaw Public School System, and twenty years at Delta College as Adjunct Professor of History. In between I have chaired a local environment group, and was elected to two four year terms as a Monitor Township trustee.   I believe your job is vital if fairness is to return to Michigan’s electoral process. My community of interest begins with Bay County where I grew up and raised a family.  I believe in the integrity of county boundaries.  For state representation, I urge you to respect Bay County’s townships and city border.   For state senatorial consideration, I identify with and believe the interests of the core urban areas of Bay County, Saginaw County, and the city of Midland, require representation: Shared industrial history, shared infrastructural needs, shared potable and recreational water system. Also, while industrialization has brought wealth, it has left a legacy of contamination such as GM’s PCB contamination and Dow’s dioxin, both of which have or are being addressed, but new threats such as agricultural fertilizer and pesticide runoff and CAFO operations require vigilance as well as the implications of climate change. Yet, for decades our state senators, because of gerrymandering, have come from rural agricultural communities. This requires redress.  Similarly, I believe my community of interest for congressional representation should follow the rivers and include Bay, Saginaw, Midland, and Genesse counties.  We are bound to the I-75 corridor, our history, and the watershed that has the Saginaw and Tittabawassee rivers as its lifelines.  For decades the joint U.S./Canadian treaty group, the International Joint Commission (IJC) has identified the Saginaw River and Bay as one of the 42 most polluted Areas of Concern.  Great strides have been made by both governments to address these water impairments, but a federal advocate is essential if progress is to continue. Likewise, the protection of wetlands. This, our most biologically robust ecosystem, provides habitat, flood control, and spawning ground for commercial and recreational fishing, and requires a committed federal watchdog.  Our core cities will also play a central role in coping with climate change as federal efforts promote renewable energy strategies from roof top solar and coastal wind turbines to regulations regarding conservation and efficiency, brownfield development, vertical gardens, and more. Please consider keeping the legislative needs of these core cities in mind when redistricting.  Respectfully,  Terry R. Miller 4649 David Ct Bay City, MI  48706  "
1346,written,,,District of Midland County ,"My name is Cindy Weir,  and I worked, along with many others,  very hard here in Midland County to help create this very commission, and am very excited about the new lines to be drawn without the intention of political gain.  My community of Interest is to keep  Midland County whole as the 98th House District.   In past reapportionments the 98th has been drawn to exclude our surrounding townships. These have been included with Isabella in the 99th, but these people live, shop and send their kids to school in Midland County.   My ask is to keep Midland County intact in the 98th District, and draw geographically compact senate and congressional districts.    Thank You for all your hard work!   "
1347,written,,traverse city,Schwantes ideas on Traverse Region,"The Traverse City region has multiple layers of community interest.  The region is roughly the counites of Grand Traverse, Leelanau, Benzie, Antrim, Kalkaska and in some aspects Wexford.  The Intermediate School District serves these counties. The public transportation systems converge on Traverse City as it the prime commercial and employment hub. The the agricultural focuses on cherries and wineries are served through the regions co-ops and associations. The tourism industry unifies these counties in it's promotions. Traverse City is the central lodging site for people to explore this region.  Munson Health Care Serves these counties as the major hospital system.  The current 101 legislative district was drawn without this region integration in mind. It stretches from Leelanau to Ludington. Ludington and Manistee are not part of this particular region in any way.  I would hope that the new House and Senate districts would restore some political cohesion for our region. "
1348,written,,,Return to equal representation,"I am a 57 year old woman who for most of my life have identified and voted loyally to the Republican party because of its values and principles.  Now the Republican party no longer stands on or represents any principle, ethic, or value.  What it has evolved into does not even represent American values.  It no longer cares about it's mainstream constituents.  Instead it caters to and courts the votes of fringe, extreme, and terror driven groups of white nationalism.  The Republican party no longer represents me.  It's not my party anymore.   District lines have been abused, twisted, and morphed to favor one party over another to ensure that one party wins certain areas.  Far too long we have allowed gerrymandering to dictate and run the outcomes of our elections under the guise of fair districting.  The results have been destructive to our state and nation.  Our state and federal politicians are abusing and poisoning our voting processes.  We have dangerous and destructive voices in our state and federal governement who espouse anti-semitic, racist rhetoric.  There isn't a week that goes by that I am not outraged, or incensed by something a representative has said or done.  In our U.S. House of Representatives we have a Republican caucus who stripped the power from a woman who stood on principle and spoke in truth, while they remain silent as others who reflect loudly anti-semitic views and distort history.  We have ignorant politicians who don't even have a sensical grasp of history and civic government.  How districts are drawn are critical to the success of our democracy.  In recent years our democratic way of life has been attacked continually, and is under threat of destruction.  And what used to be covert efforts to silence the political will of people of color is not an overt attack on their rights to vote.  Voter suppression is well underway in politically lopsided states and regions.  If you don't get this right NOW, we will very soon resemble nations led by dictators with false elections such as China,  Belarus, Venezuala, Russia.  Our democracy will fail.  Whatever you do in drawing these lines in our state, GET IT RIGHT, MAKE IT BALANCED!   Every candidate should have an equal chance of winning."

The City of Midland is connected to Bay City by US 10 and Midland road. And to Saginaw by M-47 and M-46 and I-75 and I-675. Saginaw and Bay City are connected directly by M 84, M 13, and  I -75, I-675 as well as other indirect routes.  Thousands of commuters use these roads to travel between these three cities for work, shopping, arts and entertainment, and health care each day. These cities are known as the Tri-CIties. They share history, development, MBS airport, sports competitions, and higher level educational institutions. There is enough population that they should be represented in the State Senate. When drawing district lines for the State Senate please put Bay, Saginaw and Midland Counties together in a Senate District. "

1352,written,,,END THE GODFORSAKEN GERRYMANDERING. ,"The newly drawn districts should incorporate the following criteria and standards.  Other considerations should be rendered irrelevant and suspect, particularly when you have ridiculously shaped districts like 5, 4 and 13 and 14.   1. The commission should analyze how many prospective voters are in a district based on current registered voter rolls and come up with districts that would allow/maximize everyone's ability to vote within a given geographical area, with a priority to easing voters' ability to get to the polls and to making the voting process as easy and efficient as possible.  As such, limits should be imposed and be taken into consideration regarding the time voters spend to get to the polls and how many potential voters a voting location might be expected to process during any given elections.   That number should be balanced/reasonable as to ensure that people don't stay in line to vote beyond say, 20 minutes.    2. Root out and throw out any considerations that may even be potentially be linked to making sure one political party will dominate in any districts.  Ensure as much parity as possible, while still respecting the criteria above, between registered members of both major political parties in all districts. "
1353,written,,,Michiganders over politics ,"I strongly urge the commission to fulfill its duties in good faith to meet the ultimate goal of determining fair districting for the state legislature and U.S congressional districts. Free and fair elections are the cornerstone of a healthy democracy, and redistricting a heavily gerrymandered Michigan to accurately represent its constituents and communities, will allow our great state to truly represent the will of its people. Government is supposed to rely on the consent of the governed. Fair maps are absolutely necessary to that. I urge the Commission to  follow the specific criteria outlined in the state constitution as it draws our new district lines. Namely, 1.  Districts shall be of equal population as mandated by the U.S. Constitution and shall comply with the voting rights act and other federal laws. 2. Districts shall reflect the state's diverse population and communities of interest. Communities of interest may include, but shall not be limited to, populations that share cultural or historical characteristics or economic interests. Crucially, please remember that communities of interest do not include relationships with political parties, incumbents, or political candidates. Thank you for your time and serious consideration of how your work will impact the rights of all Michiganders. "

This region has identified growth trends and have predicted regionally that our MPO could cross numerous county, township and municipal boundaries in the Traverse City Region. Including Leelenau County with Traverse City and parts of the metro area of Grand Traverse County might be helpful as most of the population base falls within this district.

1357,written,,"battle creek city,coldwater,publicdata",Adjudicating COIs with Public Data,"Hello, My name is Nicholas Martens, and I just completed my first year at the University of Michigan. I am a lifelong Climax resident, and I addressed the Commission at the May 13 meeting in Kalamazoo. I wanted to furnish the commission with additional information.  Redistricting reform animated my political beliefs before I could even vote. I spent about a year of high school trying to quantify partisan gerrymandering, culminating with an R program. I finished my project in March of 2019, shortly after Proposal 2 passed. My largest criticism of the ballot proposal before it passed remains true today: communities of interest lack a durable standard. Without a clear standard for assessing the relative importance of COIs, the commission will grant representation to COIs with louder public input, which generally skew old, white, and affluent.  I am not the first to recognize the problem. “The Role of Communities of Interest in Redistricting,” written by the Center for Local, State, and Urban Policy in the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy and included in the Commissioners’ orientation binders, references the challenge of undefined COIs. The report acknowledges that some COIs lack consciousness, while others benefit from institutional advocacy channels (8). Unless the Commission ameliorates the imbalance of power inherent in the current system of COI formation, the MICRC’s line-drawing project will not reflect the whole state. Executive Director Hammersmith called the Constitutional definition of COI “pretty vague” during a conversation with Commissioner Lett regarding the CLOSUP database on February 11 (pp. 12-14 of transcript). More recently, the Commission discussed communities of interest on April 22 (pp. 26-33 of transcript). Commissioner Clark wondered how the Commission would “sort out” public submissions of COIs (27). Later in the same discussion, Vice Chair Szetela noted that the Commission would need to “balance” the demands of different COIs (29). Further, General Counsel Pastula lamented the absence of a mechanism for verifying population estimates provided via the online COI submission portal (30). Clearly, equitably adjudicating citizen-defined COIs looms over the Commission’s line-drawing process.  While I am no expert, I sincerely hope the Commission succeeds. I implore the Commission to use publicly available Census data to measure the robustness of COIs. By using public data, the Commission can easily justify the redistricting plan to anybody with an internet connection. Once the Commission completes the first maps in a couple months, most public comments will be either “Why am I in this district” or “Why isn’t this locality in my district.” While no answer will satisfy the most enraged constituents, the MICRC should strive to uphold non-partisan rationality and equity. Public data offers the single best avenue for maintaining public confidence in the Commission.  As I noted in my testimony on May 13, I prefer Census commuting data called Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics: Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES), available at https://onthemap.ces.census.gov/. The Census compiles data from Unemployment Wage Insurance Records and Office of Personnel Management records, so LODES includes almost every worker in the United States. Commuting data can be viewed at geographies as small as the Census block group. Further, anyone can analyze custom shapes on the map (perhaps a hypothetical COI or district). Many of the other types of COIs worked in limited contexts (agricultural regions don’t work in Detroit and linguistic communities won’t help much in anglophone-dominated Climax). Additionally, many COIs suffer from differing levels of political consciousness. Census data can level the playing field for communities that may lack the resources to pack meetings and inundate the Commission with feisty emails.  Commuting data can help the Commission decide between contending communities of interest. For example, many people at the Kalamazoo hearing expressed strong opinions regarding the addition of either Battle Creek or Branch County to the Sixth Congressional District. Barring any shocking data in the PL 94-171 file or modifications to the district, only one could be included in the new Sixth, not both. Census commuting data can equitably test the robustness of the two competing COIs by establishing which contributes more workers to employers in the Sixth Congressional District I know the Commission faces many onerous time requirements, so I provided instructions to establish whether Branch County or City of Battle Creek residents rely more heavily on the economy of the Sixth. I tested the directions on my parents and stepparents for clarity. The directions take no more than ten minutes to complete.   1.	Go to https://onthemap.ces.census.gov/. 2.	Type “battle creek” in the search bar on the left side of the screen. 3.	Click “Search” and click on “Battle Creek city, MI.” The map will pivot to Battle Creek and automatically save the outline of it.  4.	Type “branch county” in the search bar on the left side of the screen. 5.	Click “Search” and click on “Branch County, MI.” The map will pivot to Branch County and automatically save the outline of it. 6.	Type “mi-06” in the search bar on the left side of the screen.  7.	Click “Search” and click on “MI-06.” The map will pivot to the Congressional district. 8.	Click “Perform Analysis on Selection Area”. 9.	Since we want to know how many people work in the Congressional District, mark “Work” under the Home/Work Area section. 10.	Click on “Destination” (the third option down on the middle part of the menu). 11.	Click “Go”. 12.	A map will appear. On the left hand side of the screen, four tabs will appear. 13.	Click on “Selection,” the third one from the left. 14.	Click “Confirm and Add Advanced Selection”. 15.	Scroll to the bottom of the page, to a section called “Previous Shapes.” Click “Reuse Selection” under Battle Creek, MI. 16.	Click “Confirm Advanced Selection”. 17.	The map should pivot to Battle Creek and a menu should appear. Click “Perform Paired Area Analysis” on the menu. 18.	Another menu will appear. Click “Primary Jobs” in the rightmost column (primary jobs are an individual’s main source of income, so each worker only has one). 19.	Click “Go”. 20.	Another map of the Sixth Congressional District will appear, showing where Battle Creek residents work. The largest and darkest circles cluster around Kalamazoo, indicating the largest commuter flows.  21.	Look at the numbers on the right side of the screen. The one on top indicates about 2,800 people live in the City of Battle Creek but work in the Sixth.  22.	On the left side of the screen, click the “Advanced” tab from the left. 23.	Click “Cancel Advanced Selection” on the left side of the screen. 24.	Once again, click “Confirm and Add Advanced Selection”. 25.	Scroll to the bottom of the page, to a section called “Previous Shapes.” Click “Reuse Selection” under Branch County, MI. 26.	Click “Perform Paired Area Analysis”. 27.	A map of the Sixth Congressional District will appear, showing where people Branch County residents work. The largest and darkest circles cluster around Sturgis, indicating the largest commuter flows. About 2,500 people lived in Branch. County but work in the Sixth.  In 2018, about 300 more residents of the City of Battle Creek worked in the Sixth Congressional District. Based on commuting data, Battle Creek forms a more robust community of interest with the Sixth. While a case exists for a COI encompassing either Branch County or Battle Creek, the Cereal City benefits from a larger flow of workers to the Sixth By relying on Census data, the Commission levels a playing field that currently favors well-resourced populations. At the Kalamazoo meeting, only three of the 65 speakers were college or high-school aged. Even if young people (or any other under-represented group) fail to attend Commission meetings, their commuting patterns are recorded by the Census Bureau and available at OnTheMap. Thus, their COIs can still shape redistricting, ensuring the Michigan Independent Citizen Redistricting Commission embodies egalitarian principles that drove many voters to originally vote “Yes” on Proposal Two.  I wish the Commission luck over a grueling stretch of months!    Best,  Nicholas Martens 380 Thistle Ave Climax, MI 49034  "
1358,written,,otsego,What counties are similar to mine,"I live in Otsego County and in looking at my state Senate district 36 and state House district 105, I see counties grouped together in these districts that I know are not similar in terms of culture/economic backgrounds. Since you may be unfamiliar with this area, I'd like to share my perspective on which counties I view to be similar.  Just by looking at the Senate district 36's long, weird shape you could guess that it includes dissimilar areas. In my view, Otsego County does not share much in common with Midland, Gladwin, Arenac, and Iosco counties. It does not make sense for Otsego County to be in the same district as those counties. To me, it would make sense for Otsego County to be grouped with counties like Crawford, Montmorency, Oscoda, Alpena, etc.  The House district 105 is not as bad in terms of grouping dissimilar counties. However, Otsego County has more in common with Crawford, Montmorency, Oscoda, Kalkaska counties than it does with Antrim and Charlevoix counties."
1359,written,,,To The Michigan Redistricting Commission,"To the Michigan Redistricting Commission,   As a Shiawassee County resident I am deeply vested in ensuring my Community of Interest remains intact and that long established local units of government are given the highest consideration when drawing the lines.   As you consider the 2021 apportionment for congressional districts, state senate districts, state house districts, and county commission districts, please consider using the following criteria:   • Contiguity – If the commission considers cultural, historical, and economic relationships, they cannot do so while at the same time ignoring geographic contiguity.   • Compactness – without this criterion, it would be very confusing for voters, difficult for candidates to represent effectively, and the district lines would not represent a Community of Interest. Cultural, economic, and historical relationships are in most cases inseparable from a geographic relationship. Cites, villages, townships, and counties share a common bond and are by themselves a Community of Interest. • The Reock Score – This is the one of the ways the commission can ensure compactness when drawing district lines. • County, Township, City, Town, or Village boundaries – Obviously units of local government will have to be divided in some cases. However, keeping local units together should be a high priority. The elected official in each district should be representing the entire community, county, city, village, or town if possible. State representatives, state senators, or member of congress often interact with local elected officials. Splitting local units of government forces those who serve in local office to interact with multiple representatives who serve completely different Communities of Interest.   I am thankful for your consideration of these items and I am asking the commission to give them the highest priority when drawing district lines. It is important that Michigan’s districts remain fair, equitable, and compact in accordance with the requirements laid out in Proposal Two of 2018.   Sincerely, Shelly L. Ochodnicky "
1360,written,,,Districts That Represent Their Peoples,"Good afternoon.  I am a lifetime resident of Northern Michigan, growing up in Mackinac County and residing in Cheboygan County since 1997.   I have been employed as a clerk with the Michigan DNR since 1994.  I believe the voters of Michigan approved this Commission in order to remove political engineering of districts and to ensure the best representation of the People within them.  To this end, I believe that districts should be made as compact/symmetrical as possible, and should follow established County lines first, then township/city/village lines only when necessary to balance district sizes.  Compact districts will minimize travel times for our elected representatives; will improve logistics and communication; and most importantly would create more diversity within each district.  We should never, ever, have districts based upon voting history, race, or any other demographics.  This is America.  We are the great melting pot of world history, and should honor that ideal going forward.  Thank you for your time and service!  Regards,  Andy Evans Cheboygan MI"
1361,written,,charlevoix,Redistricting in Northern Michigan,"My name is Richard Spring, and I am the Chair of the Charlevoix County Democratic Party. I am glad to have the opportunity to submit my written testimony to the Commission. Thanks to the voters of the state, we have a chance to correct some of the gerrymandering manipulations of the last three decades. The Republican Party did not want this Commission to be formed and would like to keep in place the boundaries they established that unfairly benefited them. That is not acceptable.  Democrats in Michigan have been at a considerable disadvantage for many years. Despite receiving most votes for both the State House and Senate in 2018, Democrats failed to win either Chamber. In fact, in 5 0f the 10 elections so far this century, voters in Michigan overwhelmingly voted for Democrats but Republicans prevailed. Michigan voters deserve fair representation.  Northern Michigan districts do not adequately reflect our communities of interest. Communities that border the great lakes are a perfect example. We are bound by our dependence on our natural resources, tourism, and other similar economic factors. Protecting those interests is paramount, and too often the controlling party has ignored these communities of interest.  We have every faith in this commission being able to do the right thing in helping to make our elections fairer and more equitable. Thank you for your time and consideration. "
1362,written,,,Redistricting Thoughts ,"Redistricting Committee:  I am writing today with concerns on how redistricting will effect our local Lenawee township clerk’s office and the precinct’s voting procedures.  I have worked at least seven elections in Lenawee County, four of them were presidential years.  During these elections when people request ballots there is only one ballot to disperse, with the exception of  primary elections where the electorate must request the party affiliation ballot.   These primary elections often cause confusion for the electorate.  When this happens individuals  feel as if the clerk’s office is intruding on their privacy.  I fear changes made during Redistricting may result in multiple ballot options and cause confusion to the electorate and again cause individuals to question privacy or concern of being disenfranchised.  Please use caution as you evaluate redistricting how you not only impact electorate, but urge precincts be kept in same counties so the reporting to the county clerk is both efficient and accurate.   Reporting must be clean and quick, otherwise there are questions of the integrity of the election.  Thank you for your time.  Jeannette Eckles"

The network is a group of community organizations that work collaboratively to improve the quality of health in our community. Other entities that work together within the network include Family Medical Center of Monroe and Lenawee, as well as United Way of Monroe and Lenawee. These community networks are important for the improving the health of citizens within the community, but as well important as it applies to government representation at the state and federal level.  For this reason, I advocate for the continued district association between Lenawee and Monroe counties as an important community of interest for the health and wellbeing of our citizens.

1365,written,,,Robert Pallarito keep current districts,"Thank you Commissioners for serving our state!  There are no changes to the 1st Congressional, 36th and 37th State Senate, and 105th State House seats needed!  The 1st Congressional district is currently made up of the ""Up North"" 44% of Michigan, including 16 counties in the Northern Lower Peninsula and all of the Upper Peninsula.  It's communities of interest include Tourism, Farming, and Natural Resource extraction (including Oil/Gas, Timber, and Minerals such as Iron Ore and Copper).  This district is rural and we often travel across one or more neighboring counties to visit doctors, banking, and social actrivities.  The 36th and 37th State Senate districts represent the tip of the mitt seperated east and west.  Northern Michigan residents tend to do their major shopping, visit medical centers, and attend Community Colleges based on, a geographical alignment, which side of I-75 they live on.  Residents residing east of I-75 tend to travel to Alpena and West of I-75 tend to travel to Petoskey, Traverse City, or Sault Ste Marie.  These cities lie on the Great Lakes coasts, away from the inland heavy snow belts.  Television and radio markets align themselves in this same manner.  Alpena serves the east, Traverse City and the Soo serve the North and West.  This geographical alignment represents the 36th and 37th.  The 105th House district is a community of interest due to several factors.  These counties are made up of the Northern ""Snowbelt"" counties, receiving an abundance of the white stuff in the winter.  This lends this area to be perfect for winter recreational activities.  Its snow and rolling terrain are home to many ski resorts.  Snowmobiling is another major winter tourism windfall for the area, breathing economic life into an otherwise difficult time for business.  In the summer, melting snow contributes to the many lakes and streams, producing fishing and boating activities. The last major community of interest for the 105th House District is the abundance of gas/oil and Timber production.  The Niagran Reef and Antrim Shale, among others, and the abundance of forested land provide the core of jobs in the district.

1366,written,,,Arts Programs and Redistricting,"I am Jacob Gates, executive director of The Franke Center for the Arts in Marshall, a non-profit performing arts venue located in Calhoun County. While I'm not writing today to advocate for any particular redistricting map, I would remind the committee that arts organizations like ours often derive a portion of our funding from MCACA and other governmental grant making entities. Our organization reaches an audience from a fairly wide region, but other organizations may provide content and services tailored to narrower or more specific constituencies. The makeup and geographic distribution of these arts constituencies are important to consider during the redistricting process so that representation and funding are distributed equitably among arts organizations within the state. As I'm sure you are aware, the health of arts organizations is important from both a cultural and an economic perspective. Thank you for taking the time to consider my testimony. "
1367,written,,,Leelanau County Communities of Interest,"May 20, 2021  Dear Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission  Thank you for taking my testimony  My name is Barbara Conley and I live in Northport, which is in Leelanau County, MI.  I would like to make 2 points.  The first is to entreat this committee to just draw fair maps.  In April of 2019, Michigan’s  1st  Congressional district was deemed by a Federal court to have been gerrymandered to favor Republicans after the last census.  For example, in 2018, the majority of voters in Michigan voted for Democrats, but Republicans won both the Michigan House and Senate.  I do believe that the voters need to pick their representatives, and not the other way around. Second, I would like to speak about communities of interest.  I would like to let the committee know that Leelanau County, where I live, does have ties to northern Grand Traverse County and the citizens particularly near Lake Michigan and Grand Traverse Bay may be considered a community of interest.   The two counties were until recently responsible for the Cherry Capital Airport.  Health care, particularly hospital and specialists, is largely available only in Traverse City.  In addition, the two counties share agricultural ties, in cherry, wine grapes and other fruit growing, as well as the farm to table effort.  They share an intermediate school district and of course tourism.  They should be considered as a Michigan House district.  Leelanau County also shares a health department with Benzie County, as well as tourism; and shares cherry farming and tourism with Antrim, Charlevoix and Emmet counties – perhaps these should be considered for a Michigan Senate district. In summary: I ask for fair districts so that our representation in Congress and the State Legislature reflects the will of the voters and no one feels their vote is wasted.  I ask that the commission follow the specific criteria for the redrawing of districts in the MICRC process, and draw districts that take into account how citizens relate to each other, and therefore need to be represented, and not to draw  districts to favor any incumbents or favor any specific political party. Thanks to all of you for serving on this committee.  Your service is greatly appreciated.  Sincerely Barbara Conley MD Northport, MI 49670  "
1368,written,,,Decision making process,"I have listened to all MICRC meetings since February, and two of the Public Hearings (Jackson and Kalamazoo).  I applaud the Commission's dedication to the process and to transparency. However, I am concerned that the format of the public testimony received is so varied that collating and summarizing is going to be unproductive.  I have not heard the Commission discuss the process by which they will use public testimony, particularly on communities of interest, to make decisions.   It would seem that deciding now on some of the parameters of the decision process might actually help you get better, more useable, input from the public at hearings. "
1369,written,,,Leelanau County Community of Interest,"First, Thank-You for undertaking the daunting task of redistricting Michigan!  I'm sure it is a difficult and complex task. I would like to suggest that the Commission consider combining Leelanau County and Grand Traverse County into the same District.  We are currently combined with Benzie, Manistee, and Mason Counties but really have very little in common with these Counties but we do share many commonalities with Grand Traverse County.  Grand Traverse and Leelanau share Grape growing and Wineries and tourism based on these, a public bus transportation system called BATA that runs through both counties, a hospital system, a school system to mention just a few.  We Leelanau residents go to Traverse City to shop, dine, go to movies, participate in events, and grocery shop.  We share none of these commonalities with Benzie, Manistee or Mason Counties.  I would argue that combining Leelanau with these 3 counties does not make sense if keeping communities of interest together is a goal of the Commission.   Thank you for your consideration.  "
1370,written,,,Keep Bay County Intact,"Thank you Commissioners, my name is Cindy LeVasseur. I live in Pinconning Twp. in northern Bay County. I would like to see all of Bay county included in a state house district. I am not represented in my state house district as it currently runs west and includes Midland and several Midland county townships.  I have no reason to go to Midland, it is 32 miles away on dark country roads.  Like Pinconning, Bay City is in Bay County and is only 18 miles away connected by M-13 and I-75. It is my community of interest.  In Bay county I do banking, attend church, and visit family. It is where I shop, eat in restaurants and keep doctor appointments. I visit the parks on the shoreline for birdwatching and have joined the Rotary; where we create service projects to enhance our community. I ask that in a map for State house and a congressional district, that northern Bay county not be separated and combined with another county but kept intact with all of Bay county.  "
1371,written,,,Land Division,"Living in Harbor Springs, but on the border between two townships, I often feel the benefits of the diversity of the current districting. Harbor Springs is a summer town surrounded by rural land. In town, we have three historical museums, an historic library, and many businesses that have generations of belonging to this community. There are six churches of various religious viewpoints. There is a community of the Odawa Tribe. We also have a strong interest in local farmers and have a wonderful summer farmer's market.  Within five minutes of downtown Harbor Springs, farm  fields can be seen. Within eight minutes, there are two families that raise cattle for local meat. It is a wonderful mixture of small but vibrant local community members, the majority having roots that go back generations. My own family was one of the original families to settle in Friendship Township in the 1800s.  I would like to request that our district be preserved with all its diversity and commitment to Michigan Heritage and tradition of rural life. Please, as much as possible, shape the districts in a way that maintains their counties and communities and compact divisions. Thank you for considering all of our impute. Good Luck  and Do Well."
1372,written,,frankfort city,Mark Smith's districting testimony,"My name is Mark Smith, I live at 4034 2nd Street Frankfort, MI 49635 on the north shore of Lower Herring Lake. Thank you for volunteering to establish our new district lines. My roots grow deep here. My Great Great Grandfather Hans Gudemoos, born 1/3/1843 in North Germany, was commissioned as a first officer in the German Navy and sailed the open ocean. In 1870 Hans left the saltwater for the fresh waters of the Midwest Great Lakes. On a routine stop in Elberta he was attracted to it’s natural beauty and decided to make Elberta his home with his new bride Anna. They lived the rest of their lives with Hans sailing the great lakes in his ship the Magnolia. Unfortunately the Magnolia was driven on the beach at Lake County, IL in 1894. Hans and his cabin boy (and son) Mark survived and returned to Elberta. Mark had a daughter Frances. Frances had a daughter Marilyn. Marilyn had a son Mark. Sue and I have two kids and now 3 grandkids. All 7 of these generations have cherished the unspoiled lakes, rivers and lands of this area. We have good schools, libraries, medical facilities, low crime rates and a relaxed friendly way of life. Sue and I are now retired on the north shore of Lower Herring Lake and look forward to sharing this M22 way of life with our extended family and friends. The current Districting works well, we ask that you keep this in mind as you complete your appointed task.  Sincerely   Mark Smith "
1373,written,,,Fair Mapping,"Leelanau County, Michigan is my Community of Interest.    We have lived in this  county for 20 years now.   We have strong ties here as residents and business owners.  We know our neighbors by name.  Our family enjoys the outdoors and all that Leelanau county has to offer, known one of the top destination places in the US, and is home to us who enjoy and want to preserve its beauty.    We are even very different from our neighboring city Traverse City which is in Grand Traverse County.  We ask that you keep our counties in tact to preserve what is special about Northern Michigan.  Keep Leelanau County district in tact please !!!"
1374,written,,,"The danger of ""positive"" redistricting.","My focus in submitting this testimony concerns the criteria on which the Commission is to base the newly drawn districts.  I understand that there are 7 separate criteria.  One is mandated by the US and Michigan Constitutions--the districts are to be essentially equal in population.  This implements a fundamental tenet of our democratic government: One Man, One Vote.  The Commission must draw districts with equal numbers of people. Two of the criteria concern the shape or geography of the new districts: they must be reasonably compact and geographically contiguous.  These criteria are mechanical and are tools by which the districts can achieve the other  more political or philosophical goals.  Similarly, the requirement that the maps take into account existing governance boundaries such as counties, cities, townships and other established governing entities is unambiguous and relatively easy to implement. The remaining 3 criteria are of a different nature.  Two criteria concern the circumstances which are the genesis of the term gerrymandering and which were the principal forces driving the citizen efforts which resulted in the ballot proposal: the manipulation of the process of designating electoral voting districts by the political parties and elected officials in order to affect the electoral outcome in their favor.  I have every confidence that the Commission will scrupulously avoid partisan and incumbent bias in designing electoral maps.  To do otherwise would be to abrogate the trust of the people of Michigan and to ignore the very responsibilities of their positions.  All redistricting is gerrymandering in nature.  But the commission must avoid even the appearance of doing ""negative"" redistricting--it must resist all attempts, however subtle or creatively packaged, whose purpose is to create advantage for a specific candidate or political party.  If the Commission is perceived as favoring any existing political entity or person its credibility and, by extension, the moral force behind the anti-gerrymandering movement will be compromised.  Success of the initiative may be thwarted.   The remaining criterion, the creation of districts that reflect Michigan's diverse populations and communities of interest, presents a more difficult problem.  Even if the purpose or goal is to encourage representation in government by all the various cultural, ethnic, racial, economic, geographical, philosophical, etc., peoples of our state and even if better governance would result from the interplay of these differing ideas and interests, the deliberate attempt to insure the election of a particular group or individual is gerrymandering of a sort hardly distinguishable from the ""negative"" kind already mentioned.  Attempts to encourage ""positive"" redistricting are still the evil we are attempting to excise. Is there no middle ground, no moderate position in manipulating the districting process?  Especially of late there is an observable phenomenon that districts that are very homogenous produce elected officials that are more extreme in their political beliefs.  As more homogenous communities of people reside together, more of these extremist politicians crowd out the moderate voices and governing becomes more difficult  and ineffective as a result.  The minority voices are silenced.  Primaries become the key elections, forcing candidates to espouse the positions of only their base electorate.  The legislature is stalemated. If our goal in districting is create the conditions that will result in effective, efficient government, should we not encourage the creation of districts that have many differing peoples and communities whose voices can be heard by all voters?  Compromises must happen in order to avoid dominance by any one majority.  I write to encourage the Commission to moderate its application of all of the criteria in order to move toward creating districts that are more diverse.   "
1375,written,,,Comments on my community of interest,"I am a resident and voter in Burt Township, Cheboygan County. I am commenting on redistricting lines and community of interest. My comments are pretty general. I will break them down into items that I believe are essential and then those that are strongly recommended. Essential items of consideration: 1) I believe that ALL districts for all legislative seats that have districts MUST be contiguous throughout (i.e., not have two or more sections that are not connected) and that the law probably requires that still, 2) districts must be what works best for Michigan and not be influenced by any other state, especially West Coast and East Coast states that have no more in interest with Michigan and Midwestern states than the Moon does, 3) all municipalities (townships, cities and villages) should be kept in the same district, except those cities that have a population that exceed that for a district. This is due to the impact on the municipal and county clerks who cannot have the funding and staffs necessary to deal with two legislative districts unless they are in a large city. That is true for various reasons, including the number of legislators that they need to deal with, funding, and election and ballot management. Recommended items of consideration: 3) Districts should be as ""square"" as possible to the extent that can fit county or township borders, to avoid districts that appear on maps like ""jigsaw puzzle pieces"", which is associated widely with gerrymandering. 4) As to my community of interest, it is Burt Township in Cheboygan County. Burt Township is basically surrounding the north half of Burt Lake, the second largest inland lake in Michigan by surface area, with the exception of some of the northwest area of the lake in Emmet County. While a majority of homes in Burt Lake are not on the lake, that lake nevertheless dominates life in Burt Township. Most ""off lake"" residents utilize the lake frequently for fishing, boating, ice fishing, snowmobiling etc. due to the lake accesses that are present. The healthy environment of Burt Lake is of utmost interest and importance to us. This is a very rural area. I live on a dead end dirt road about 5 miles from the nearest village, which is Topinabee in Mullett Township. Burt Township does not have within it any village. It cuts across a few different school districts, fire department service areas, and law enforcement is the Cheboygan County  Sheriff Department. There is no water or sewer system, and no public transportation. Medical services are available in the village of Indian River, and City of Cheboygan, both about 10-15 miles away. There is ambulance service available. So, Burt Township should entirely remain in one Congressional district, one State Senate district, and one State House district. And our one person part time township clerk's office only has capacity to deal with an election involving  one State House seat, and one State Senate seat. And that is all I really have to say! Thank you"
1376,written,,,Competitive elections,"When districts are drawn to favor one party, the dominant party doesn't have to recruit good candidates--people interested in making solid public policy. Anyone can run--people who don't even live in Michigan!  And the non-dominant party can recruit terrific, qualified people who will never have a chance to win. We end up with stagnant, lopsided, moribund law-making that negatively impacts people of both parties.  I live in a Congressional district, State Senate district and State House district drawn to favor one party, although Bridge Magazine's piece today on changing elections across Michigan show that our local communities of interest (and economic sparkplugs) would vote in a vastly more balanced way, and generate thoughtful policy-making.  We want choice. We want our elections to be based on the qualifications of the candidates."
1377,written,,,Communities of Interest,"Thank for you the opportunity to be heard.  To me, for communities of interest, really needs to keep municipality boundaries as much as possible. Citizens already work closely together in township, city and counties. That is where relationships - friendships and families - often are.  Local relationships are critical to success of the bigger picture of a successful Michigan. Please absolutely to do your best to keep whole counties together. If that absolutely can not happen, please don't break up cities and townships.  Also, it just makes it easier to understand for people if the Congressional Districts include whole counties.  Thank you."
1378,written,,,County lines  proponent,"Thank you for coming to the Upper Peninsula.  My name is Carol Vining Moore and I am a retiree from the Marquette Public Schools.  I am here representing the MEA.  I am also a Real Estate Broker in Marquette and I have lived here 52+ years.  I have also lived away for a few years.  I would like to encourage the commission to draw the district lines along county lines.  If you did that, all the complaints that I have heard here tonight would be taken care of.  The UP is different and we like for people to acknowledge that fact.  I understand that you are using the 2020 census which was taken during a pandemic and is already obsolete.  As a result of the pandemic, people have realized they can live and work where they choose and are moving into those areas, especially the UP.  Thank you for your time. "
1379,written,,,Level Playing Field,"To protect our democracy, it is essential that our voting be done on a level playing field. To me this means that candidates who win a majority of the votes, need to be proportionately awarded a majority of the seats. Unfortunately, due to Republican gerrymandering, a level playing field has not been the case in Michigan for decades. Overall, Michigan voters vote for more Democrats, but Republicans gain the seats. This is not a fair system, so two years ago Michigan voters overwhelmingly took action to create this wonderfully Independent citizen’s commission that you serve on. You have stepped up to redraw and adopt district boundaries that will even out the imbalance so our elections will more truly represent the will of the people. Thank you for your integrity and dedication to creating a level playing field for our citizens’ voting. This revised condition for voting will also safeguard the strength and security of our democracy. "

There is only one road in and one road out to the city of Marquette and Marquette Township. Which were all business is preformed in those area ; School, work, doctors. medical facilities, shopping, . The rep from 110th is 4 hours away and cannot give us representation. It only makes sense that Ishpeming Township and Powell Township be moved to the 109th."

Although I would have liked to attend in person, time, travel and my work prevent me from doing so. I would like to address all of you about the communities I care about the most. The first is Dickinson County, my home. I am so proud of this area! We lead the Upper Peninsula in manufacturing facilities- Verso Paper Corporation, Boss Toro Inc., Systems Control, and others. MJ Electric, Gundlach Champion and Bacco Construction are leaders in the construction industry.  We have beautiful lakes and a burgeoning Bike Trail Network, natural areas, and of course, the world famous Pine Mountain Ski Jump, which has just undergone a major $3.4 million rebuild to remain competitive among world class ski jumping venues. I love my community! I would like to see it remain compact and contiguous to Menominee and Delta counties as part of the 108th House District. My second Community of Interest is the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a whole. We here in the UP have a unique and special way of life- quality is beyond compare and our work ethic is second to none.  I would very much like to be able to say that going forward, our community will remain the same. We represent only 3% of Michigan's population, but what we lack in numbers, we make up in energy and love of our environment. The UP represents a way of life not found anywhere else in Michigan. Please keep the UP whole. Thank you so much for your time and attention."

Both are in Marquette County. They are currently in the 110th District of the western Upper Peninsula but are geographically and socially most aligned with the Marquette County region. Thank you for your time and commitment to fair voting. 
1385,written,,,End Gerrymandering,"Dear Commissioners,  Obviously, the people of Michigan voted to create the Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission because they were tired of the gerrymandering that both parties have historically engaged in.  When a political party wins a minority of votes for the state House of Representatives, for example, but wins a clear majority of the seats, something is terribly wrong.  One way to address this problem is to ensure districts meet the criteria of being compact.  I wish you the best of luck with your work.  Sincerely, Fred Cepela"

1390,written,,holland,Keep small cities undivided,"I urge you to keep small cities undivided by district lines. The specific city that I live in and am advocating is Holland, but this should apply to other small cities as well. Currently, Holland is dividing by district lines such that different parts of the city have different representatives. The Holland region is large enough that it is conceivable that there could be multiple districts going through the area, but this should not be the case for the city. The city only has around 33,000 people and they should all be represented by the same person. This should be the case even though the city is partly in Ottawa County and partly in Allegan County.  Thanks for all your hard work!"

To divide our properties, organizations, school districts, and community events into small groups would lead to inefficiency, waste, division of resources, etc.  Carving up our county, and even greater area, would weaken our voice and communal bond/support that is vital in the sometimes difficult times of rural agricultural life and work.

1394,written,,,Fair representation of my views,"I am interested in having districts that more accurately represent the views of people by area.  The district I am in has both rural and urban populations with a high concentration of rural.  My representatives live miles away from my urban area.  One in particular more than 70 miles.  While that representative is qualified to represent the rural communities, I feel that representatives closer to my area would be better suited to represent urban issues.  We have another district that includes areas less than a mile from my house.  My congressional district also includes areas more than two hours from my location.  Again another district is less than five miles from my house.  I feel that those districts better understand the issues facing my urban district.  To accurately reflect the views of the community the representatives serve, they should live in those communities.  I don't feel that someone living in a rural district can accurately represent those living in urban areas.  In many cases, my opinion is those representatives have never even driven through my area.  They cannot possibly understand areas that have English as a second language, child care and housing issues, crime related to highly populated areas.  They simply are not exposed to those issues on a daily basis.  I urge the Commission to take this into consideration when redistricting.  I want to be represented by someone that understands my area because they are familiar with my area.  Not someone who deals with farmers and small town issues on a daily basis.  I also would not want representatives more familiar with urban issues to be responsible for farmers and small town issues.  I want representation to be the best qualified that they can be.  Current districts do not allow for that.  No one should be responsible for understanding issues that they are not familiar with or have no expertise in."
1395,written,,,Michigan's Congressional District 10 ,"The 10th Congressional District combines all of the Thumb area and a small portion of northern Sterling Heights and neighboring Macomb Township. The Thumb area is heavily rural and agricultural. I live in northern Sterling Heights, which is more densely populated and has become more and more diverse in its population. These different populations have different interests and views. The congressional representatives over the years have consistently reflected the more conservative, white, agricultural community. I am asking that northern Sterling Heights be combined into the congressional district south of us so that we will have some representation in Congress of our views. Thank you."
1396,written,,,Community of Interest,"I am disappointed in the attempt to consider “communities of interest” in the district redrawing. My understanding of the original motivation for this new redistricting method was to make it blind to partisan manipulation. “Communities of interest” is just another way to achieve partisan ends through virtue signaling and posing. The blanket prejudicial attitudes that will be asserted about one “community” or another are insidious.  The history of representation in our republic has been geographical proximity as the predominant criteria. This has certainly been violated in the past. Our new redistricting system should be an effective deterrent to abuses, unless we substitute one form of manipulation for another.  Please draw the districts solely based on population density so that all Michiganders are equally represented."
1397,written,,"kalamazoo,ruralurbandivide,minoritiespriority1,minoritymajority,rural,urban,smell",The rural and urban divide,"* this testimony was presented live at the 5/13 meeting in Kalamazoo. - #28, Tom Graham  Well hi everyone, welcome to Kalamazoo, I'm Tom Graham  First off, I believe that your number one priority should be to protect every Michigan House seat representing minority majority districts.  I honestly don’t care what the district looks like, without these districts, minorities will have no voice in Congress.  Secondly, as you’ve heard several times, there is an urban/rural divide.  There are districts in the US where people who live in urban areas outnumber people who live in rural areas by a factor of 7 to 1.  As a result, the urban candidates overwhelmingly win elections in those districts.  However the consequence of winning these districts by such large margins is that people in urban areas do not win elections in the more numerous rural districts.   The question that needs to be answered is, is that outcome fair?  And the answer is, yes, it is fair.  It is the mathematical consequence of individual citizens rationally deciding to densely pack themselves and their wealth into a small geographic area in order to enjoy amenities like nearby hospitals and police stations, metro transit, sanitary sewers, city water, homeless shelters, colleges and student housing, fast broadband, 4 and 5G cell service, museums, theaters, restaurants, hair stylists and mani-pedis. Most are willing to pay higher taxes to support this way of life.  Many people who live in rural areas value hunting rights, gun rights, and property rights, like the right to spread manure or raise pigs or cows regardless of the smell, and operate combines late into the night if need be.  We all count on them for food production as well as a huge portion of the workforce for our businesses.  The absolute worst thing you can do is to disenfranchise rural voters by expanding the influence of urban residents into the rural areas.  Thank you. "
1398,written,,,suggestions for the commission,"I would like the Commission to consider basing the US House, state senate and state house seats upon each other.  We now have only 13 US house seats.  IF you divide each house district into 3 there would be 39 state senate seats.  IF you divide each state senate seat into 3 there would result in 108 state house seats.   This would result in common interests between each congressperson and 3 state senators and 9 state representatives.  You could also start with 108 state house seats, take every 3 of those to form a state senate district and then take every 3 state senate districts to form 1 US house seat. "

On the west-side - Many students, often from the area initially, live in student housing or in the Kalamazoo suburbs and commute to school. While folks that live on the east side of the city are of minority communities, often lifelong residents of the city and have different perspectives and needs from their representative than their West-side counterparts.   I believe everyone should be represented by a member of their community and the east side residents have been represented by a white person for too long. We need to see a change and I don’t see it being possible without splitting the city into two districts."
1400,written,,,Align needs to figure out district lines,"Hello.  My name is Rachel Foreman.    I first want to thank each one of you on the commission. You have volunteered your time to take on this monumental task to safeguard our democracy and I am grateful for your work.    I am here today because I am a teacher in Battle Creek, MI (at Harper Creek HS).   As I said, I am a teacher and I teach social studies.  One specific lesson deals with apportionment – one person, one vote.  Yet in 2014, the GOP won 50% of state senate seats, 48.5% of state house, and 47.5% for congressional votes. No majority and yet took over the MI House and Senate.   And that undermines our democracy.  I don’t wan any political party – Rep, dem, libertarian, Justice, green, etc – to have an “advantage”.    And what strikes me is that about a 1/5 of our teachers commute in from Kzoo each day to teach.    More than that, most of the people I know travel to Kzoo monthly – if not weekly – to get some shopping done or take in a show.    What this suggests to me is that Battle Creek and Kzoo are have similar economies and populations – more so than GR or even Barry County, of which BC is aligned in our Congressional Districts.  Historically, there seems to be split between urban and rural because their needs are very different..  Watersheds, school needs, transportation, sanitation, internet access – as we definitely learned this past year - and even employment are all very different.  I hope that when you make your decision you will consider these issues to make sure that representatives truly represent their interests.   "

1402,written,,,"Marshall, Michigan Plan","I am writing to support keeping the City of Marshall together with the surrounding townships as a community of interest and also to NOT combine Marshall with Battle Creek during redistricting.      I was born in Battle Creek and have lived most of my life in Marshall.  I am an attorney employed in private practice.  I am currently the President of the Marshall Public Schools Board of Education.  I have been on the board for 11 years and have been president for 3 years.  I have served on the Marshall Area Economic Development Alliance (MAEDA) board for 7 years and was board chair for two years.  I am vice-chair of Summit Pointe, our mental health authority.  I am the secretary of the Marshall Township Planning Commission and have served on the commission for six years.  My previous employment included seven years as Corporation Counsel for Calhoun County and three years as the Executive Director of Community and Legal Affairs for Oaklawn Hospital.  For the past 11 years, I have been involved in one way or another in every aspect of healthcare, economic development, and education in the Marshall area.  It is my belief that the City of Marshall and the surrounding townships are a community of interest and should not be divided by redistricting for three reasons.  The first is education.  MPS grew out of the annexation of smaller districts in the surrounding townships.  The MPS district has been the glue that holds these communities together.  Citizens identify as MPS taxpayers and have strongly supported the schools through bonding and other proposals through the years.  The second is healthcare.  Oaklawn is one of the few remaining independent hospitals in the lower pennisula.  It has been strongly supported through the years by the City and surrounding townships and people consider it to be ""their"" hospital.  The Board of Directors is local and is not interested in selling the hospital to some entity far, far away.  I was in charge of marketing at Oaklawn for 2 years and it is crystal clear that Marshall area people do not want to go to Bronson Battle Creek or Henry Ford Allegience.  They want access to the physicians and healthcare workers they know and trust.  Oaklawn is also a huge economic driver for the greater Marshall community, employing over 1000 people in good, high-paying jobs.  Third is economic development.  Marshall has pursued its own course over the years separate from Battle Creek.  It has developed strong, positive relationships with the adjoining townships.  The City  has a Master 425 agreement with Marshall Township and a join planning commission that has successfully providing planning for projects impacting the City and Marshall Township.  Marshall Township contains the Marshall mega-site which is a 1000 + acres of undeveloped, flat land with two power sources, two major highways, and rail.  MEDC is actively supporting the marketing and sale of this property.  There is absolutely no way that property can be developed without close collaboration between the City and the Township.  I could not think of a more clear community of interest.      I also want to point out that Marshall City and Marshall township have a long history of collaboration that lead to the construction of the Michigan Regional Law Enforcement Center which is the only joint State, County, and CIty law enforcement facility in the State.  This was accomplished in large part through close work with Speaker Jase Bolger and Senator Mike Nofs.  To split the City from the surrounding townships and to combine in some way with Battle Creek would stop any new project like that dead in its tracks.  Marshall's voice would be lost in discussions with Battle Creek which have very different goals and resulting outcomes.  Please consider not making any change to the community of interest that consists of Marshall and the surrounding townships, all of which are currently in the 63rd House District.  Sincerely,  Richard Lindsey  "
1403,written,,"competitive,fair",Proposed Congressional Map in DRA,"I have a second proposed map from Dave's Redistricting Atlas (not submitting in the ""other link"" form because the portal cuts the urls off so they don't work).   Under this map, the college cities of Ann Arbor and Kalamazoo are united because they have a shared community interest in that they have economies tied to higher ed. Additionally, I have united Muskegon and Grand Rapids because they have some of the largest communities of color in Western Michigan. The Greater Tri-Cities region are also united into a single district. Further, the map retains two majority African American districts in the Detroit area in order to comply with the VRA. The map also creates fairly compact districts and keeps most municipalities and counties together (including 72 of 83 counties).   Additionally, the map scores well on proportionality and competitiveness criteria. In 2016, Trump would have won 4 districts solidly (>20 points) while Clinton would have one 2 solidly (>20 points) and 1 comfortably (>10 points). The remaining 6 districts were highly competitive (<5 point margin) with Trump narrowly winning 3 and Clinton narrowly winning 3. The overall breakdown of 7 Trump-6 Clinton districts seems appropriate given that Trump narrowly carried the state in that election. The median district is also very close to the overall partisan lean of the state.  Here is the link to the map in DRA: https://davesredistricting.org/join/1279a2ca-54d8-4841-b513-a6c3b6a133b0   "
1404,written,,,"Blind, unbiased selection of districts.","For selecting voting districts, the commission should NOT pay attention to playing favorites towards ANY group. Districts should start at either the SE or SW corner of the state and from there try to be as square shaped as possible and therefore not play any kind of even slightly gerrymandering games. Once the commission starts trying to pick who is in what voting district, this starts a very slippery Road that can end up being closer to what we have today then what is ideal. A voter is a voter, and so as long as each district is picked without trying to make adjustments, which are necessarily then showing biases, then there can be no accusations of playing favorites towards any group. Currently, many cities are already divided  into several districts. Of course there is nothing at all wrong with that. So in summary, please just use geographical areas for picking districts and please don't judge people by whatever to try to put them into any specific District along with other specific people.  Thank you for your service."
1405,written,,,Making sense of the boundaries,"The district voting boundaries should align with boundaries of contiguous municipalities.

1406,written,,,Community of Interest and Comment,"Thank you to each member of the MICRC for your commitment of your time and energies to the difficult task of redistricting.  It is much appreciated by my husband and myself that there are many decisions and the time frame is challenging.   My community of interest and my concern that all of Livonia retain the same state representation in the districting line decisions.   I agree with some earlier comments during public comments in the Jackson town hall referring to using school systems as a logical basic place to grow a community of interest from.  I would add the larger area of the city, since many programs use city facilities, for instance but not limited to, libraries and community centers.  These facilities are affected by bond and other issues that appear on the ballot. It was very disappointing to me as I recently attempted to obtain some of the recent past versions of the voting district maps of my city.  I started with the Michigan Secretary of State website and Redistricting pages.  I found a lot of population and other statistics, couldn’t access a map.  I called my city’s Clerk office and was told those maps were in Lansing.  In all, after at least four calls it seems those maps are unavailable.  I like to compare visually what the changes had been in the most recent iterations of the maps.  I had noticed over the years (I have lived in this city since 1977) that some state and Federal representatives that I remember voting for no longer appear on my ballot.  I assumed that was due to redistricting.  Thank you again to the Commission and staff, I hope to be able to attend one of the town hall meetings. "

In addition to these intra-county connections, the Lenawee ISD and school districts here sometimes partner with Hillsdale and Jackson counties, and their four-year colleges and community colleges.

1409,written,,,"Cass, VanBuren, & Berrien Counties","My name is Naomi Ludman. I am a long-time resident of Cass County and I want to say first of all that I am a strong supporter of this Commission, and I am optimistic that the Commission will draw lines that are fair and based on communities of interest and drawn in ways that do not show partiality to one party or another.  Over the past few years, as a Democrat, I have felt that my vote has been diluted because our state and congressional districts have been drawn by one party in a way that has favored that party in terms of election outcomes. At this moment,I am afraid for our Democracy, and I fear that my vote in future elections might not count. One way of protecting our Democracy is that we are represented in a balanced way in our legislature, and that is more likely to happen when the lines are drawn in an open and transparent way by an independent group of citizens that does not favor one political party over the other.   I am looking for this commission to draw lines in a fair, transparent, and impartial way, and one that considers communities of interest.  Thank you for your work. As a life-long educator, I want to talk about some of the educational connections that help to make Cass, Van Buren, and Berrien Counties a community of interest.  These same connections do not exist with St. Joseph County to our east.  Consequently, we in Cass County do not see ourselves fitting well with 59th State House district. Years ago, I worked for Tri-County Head Start, a group that is still a strong force in the lives of young children and their families in Cass, Van Buren and Berrien counties. I worked for 35 years as a teacher and administrator at Southwestern Michigan College in Dowagiac. Our students are predominantly from Cass, Berrien, and Van Buren Counties.  Cass County students also choose to attend Lake Michigan College in Benton Harbor.  Cass County students don’t go east to Glen Oaks Community College.  In addition, SMC has a second campus in Niles as does Lake Michigan College, reinforcing the connections between Berrien and Cass Counties. The K-12 schools in Cass County are also connected to Southwestern Michigan College and Lake Michigan College through early college programs, and Cass and Van Buren counties share the Van Buren Skills Center in Lawrence. Likewise, the Cass County Intermediate School Districts of Cass and Berrien Counties have collaborated on a variety of projects for their teachers and students.   Consequently, when state and congressional districts are drawn, I am asking that the long-standing connections that create a community of interest between Cass, Van Buren and Berrien Counties be considered.

1415,written,,,Questions on Criteria being applied,"While the constitutional amendment has spelled out some specific criteria and placed them in an order of priority drawing an actual map will require far more specific definitions as to the criteria to be adhered to in order to produce actual maps. It seems the commission to date has spent little time debating the details of the applicable criteria. Specifically, as to the criteria enumerated, to what degree does the order of priority dictate the degree to which an item of greater priority dominates that of lower priority, and what is the variance allowable within each criterion. Further what of the various implicit map drawing criteria not enumerated in the constitution? VRA criteria are at the top of the list but I pass on that here.   More specifically I enumerate some issues below which I have not heard addressed:   (a)	Districts shall be of equal population as mandated by the United States constitution and shall comply with the voting rights act and other federal laws.  a.	Quoting from the Brennan Center Citizen’s guide to Redistricting:        i.	“There are two different standards for “equal” population in congressional districts and state legislative districts. In 1964, the Supreme Court set the bar for congressional districts very high, requiring equal population “as nearly as is practicable.”117 In practice, this means that states must make a good-faith effort to have absolute mathematical equality for each district within the state, and any differences must be specifically justified.118 For state legislative districts, the Supreme Court has allowed a bit more flexibility. These districts have to show only “substantial equality of population.”119 The Supreme Court has never said exactly how much equality is “substantial” equality. Over a series of cases, however, it has become generally accepted that the population difference between the largest and smallest state legislative districts (the “total deviation”) may not be more than 10% of the average district population.120 This is not an absolutely hard line: in some cases, a state may have a compelling reason for drawing districts with more than 10% population disparity, and in some cases, a state’s reasons may not be good enough to justify population disparities that are less than 10%.124 But 10% seems to be a generally accepted federal constitutional benchmark.” (b) Districts shall be geographically contiguous. Island areas are contiguous by land to the county of which they are a part. (c) Districts shall reflect the state's diverse population and communities of interest. Communities of interest may include, but shall not be limited to, populations that share cultural or historical characteristics or economic interests. Communities of interest do not include relationships with political parties, incumbents, or political candidates. 	a. The Commission appears to be working to address this.   (d) Districts shall not provide a disproportionate advantage to any political party. A disproportionate advantage to a political party shall be determined using accepted measures of partisan fairness.  	a. This gets to the core of the commission’s purpose but is not defined. The questions raised are many as the lines drawn will of necessity produce somewhat predictable outcomes. So, are districts drawn to maximize competitiveness in each district by balancing each party? Maximizing competitiveness would likely present significant conflicts with other criteria. How and what criteria will be applied to test for an absence of Cracking, Packing or Tacking? If districts are cracked to match the division of parties statewide in each district, then you will be possibly eliminating all republicans and if packed the opposite. How will this be balanced? Will the commission attempt to create statewide proportional representation? How will partisan bias be mapped out?  (e) Districts shall not favor or disfavor an incumbent elected official or a candidate.  	a. I take this to mean incumbent’s and candidates addresses are to be ignored. Is this the commission’s interpretation?  (f) Districts shall reflect consideration of county, city, and township boundaries.  	a. Attempting to take into account these political boundaries is likely to conflict dramatically with other criteria herein enumerated. How will this be balanced? Are there criteria for acceptable deviation?  (g) Districts shall be reasonably compact. 	a. What is the commissions intent with respect to measuring and defining compactness? Some measures are Contorted Boundaries, Dispersion, Incorporation of Population and Center of Gravity, Polsby-Popper test. Will there be some predetermined threshold level of compactness applied using one or more of the above tests and what level can be reasonably obtained while conforming to higher priority criteria?  "
1416,written,,,Calhoun County Redistricting,"For many years, Calhoun County was in a district with Kalamazoo. This made sense on many levels - we often act together due to our geography (i.e. United Way and many non-profits are both Kazoo and BC). We were then gerrymandered into a tortured district with Grand Rapids  - which has never made sense. My two cents is to consider natural geographic partners when creating the districts not ones that just benefit one political party or another. "

I’d also like to add that communities of interest include shared racial or ethnic background; common history, culture, or language; and shared socio-economic status; not just hobbies.   I support the commission drawing Branch, Hillsdale, and St. Joseph counties together.

1422,written,,,Community of Interest testimony,"I’d like to thank the commission for allowing written comments concerning the communities of interest for the task of redistricting the State of Michigan for the state legislature and congressional districts. My name is Robert Knoblauch, I am 72 years old and I am a lifelong resident of Lenawee County. My community of interest is Lenawee, Hillsdale, and Jackson Counties, I present two reasons to support this community of interest. The first, for over 42 years I have been involved with the Region 2 Planning Commission which includes the three counties mentioned above serving as a representative of Riga Township and then Lenawee County for six years. Region 2 Planning Commission is a local governmental organization serving the tri-counties of Jackson, Hillsdale, and Lenawee providing essential professional planning services for these three counties and their respective communities.  Second, for the last six years I have served as a Lenawee County representative on the Region 2 Area Agency on Aging which serve the same three counties, Jackson, Hillsdale and Lenawee. The agency provides services to help older adults and adults with disabilities to remain at home and maintain their independence. The services provided include, health care service including adult day care, counseling service, home health care, food and nutrition programs and many more services. Both the Region 2 Planning Commission and the Region 2 Area Agency on Aging have partnerships with the community of interest, the tri-county region, Jackson, Hillsdale and Lenawee counties. I believe the tri-county region meets the criteria in section 6, item 13 a-g of the amendment to Michigan’s Constitution. I strongly urge the commission to keep the tri-county district intact when drawing the congressional district map.  Thank you for your consideration. Robert Knoblauch "

I-94 is the source of significant movement between our two counties for work, shopping, and recreation. Access to I-94 for the purpose of being able to easily commute to either Jackson or Ann Arbor was a major consideration in my decision to reside in Chelsea. I travel to Ann Arbor very frequently, Jackson just a little less frequently, and at least once a month to other points along the I-94 corridor between Detroit and Chicago.  I do not feel that the combination of Livingston and Washtenaw in the present 22nd state senate district represents western Washtenaw interests effectively. While Washtenaw County and Livingston County have shared interest in north/south US-23, that corridor is located in the eastern portion of Washtenaw County. It is not readily accessible to anyone living in the cities or townships west of Ann Arbor. Any good, service, or opportunity I am interested in is much more available to me here in my own county or within the easier drive to Jackson along I-94."
1425,written,,,state senate district 16,"I have lived in Jackson for over 60 years and am excited that this committee will look seriously at redrawing our state senate district.  The current district 16th layout includes Jackson, Branch and Hillsdale Counties.  I believe Jackson County should be severed from Branch and Hillsdale Counties as they do not have a lot in common.  Both Branch and Hillsdale have always been more rural and do not share the attachment to the city of Jackson that the many surrounding County communities such as Vandercook, Michigan Center, and Columbia Township do share.    I believe we should redraw the districts so that the more urban and suburban Jackson County constituents are included with their peers from at least the western half of Washtenaw County.  The racial makeup of Jackson and Washtenaw is much closer, with 8% black/African American and 12% black/African American respectively.  Hillsdale County is less than 1%. Jackson and Washtenaw counties share the I-94 Corridor and the Amtrak railway system.  They share recreational area interests with numerous parks and camping sites.  There is nothing that draws me to Hillsdale and Branch Counties, but I have traveled often to the Chelsea area and beyond for shopping, camping and restaurants.   I am unaware of people traveling from Jackson to work in Hillsdale or Branch County, but many people from Jackson work in the Chelsea and Manchester areas and vice versa.  I appreciate the hard work that is involved in these decisions and trust this Commission to do the right thing in balancing redistricting with like communities of interest."

1427,written,,,Mid Michigan district plan,"I live in mid Michigan in Ingham County. There are many communities of interest in my county and the area that I work and live in. These communities and the common interests of them need to represented by a single state congressional district, a single state senate district and as much as possible a single US Congressional district.  1- Hospitals and Healthcare systems- Lansing and East Lansing share two large healthcare systems, Sparrow and Mclaren- these systems need to be represented in a contiguous fashion due to the need for common representation in regard to policy, access, funding and other legislative concerns.  This is especially true in regard to developing sound policy for management of the Covid pandemic  2- Roadways- The major municipalities in Ingham county share many roadways, Federal, State and local. These roadways include I-96, M43 (Grand River) , Michigan Avenue, US-127 and many other significant roadways that criss cross the county. The representation for these roadways and systems need to be represented in a contiguous fashion due to the need for common representation in regard to policy, access, funding and other legislative concerns.  3- Emergency management- Ingham County has many local and municipal first responders, by the very critical nature of the services they provide it is self evident that the need to be represented in a contiguous fashion due to the need for common representation in regard to policy, access, coordination of funding and other legislative concerns is very important for these critical services to be as successful as they can be.   4- Utilities and Infrastructure- Our county shares many inter connected systems of utility and infrastructure, which provide services for residential, commercial and industrial .  The condition of these systems varies widely across the different systems and municipalities.  It is self-evident that the need to be represented in a contiguous fashion due to the need for common representation in regard to policy, access, coordination of funding and other legislative concerns is very important for these critical services to be as successful as they can be.    5- Schools and Universities-Ingham County is home to many fantastic Universities and school systems.  We are blessed to be he home to a Big Ten University, as well as a leading community college and many smaller colleges.  We also have a number of highly rated public school systems and many successful private schools.  Due to the size, diverse nature and highly complex funding models it is very important that these schools and Universities be represented in a contiguous fashion due to the need for common representation in regard to policy, access, coordination of funding and other legislative concerns is very important for these critical services to be as successful as they can be.   6-Sustainability- The development and implementation of good sustainable practices and procedures for both residential and commercial environments is critical to the success of these initiatives.  Whether the initiative involves waste and recycling, conservation of resources or transportation it is obvious that the need for common representation in regard to policy, access, coordination of funding and other legislative concerns is very important for these sustainability initiatives to be as successful as they can be.   7-Common interests- beyond the areas of interest listed above that are a variety of other interests common to Ingham county.  Although they may not be as critical on a daily basis as the interests listed above, never the less they are very important.  Included in these are farming, agriculture, public policy, water use, energy management, public transporation, zoning, land use, business development,  "
1428,written,,,Helen's Words of Wisdom,"Communities are families.  People have memories about where they were raised.  The main goal of redistricting is for representation not ideology theories.   There is a book ""You can't Go Home Again"" by Thomas Wolfe.  That is so true in some cases.  Some communities have stayed the same for decades, others have grown very well because of wise leadership, some destroyed by corruption and greed, others are just existing, while other have disintegrated into chaos.  Families move to another community not to change it, but for the amenities such as schools, safety, shared interest (boating, hunting, sports) cultural (art, music, theater) environment (woods, water ways, biking trails, hiking).  Human traits leave their marks on communities that they have built or joined.  Great thought must go into keeping communities families together while securing honest representation for all United States citizens.  God Bless the endeavors of this commission to truly achieve a just and honest redistricting of Michigan.  Helen"
1429,written,,,Thank you for serving on the Commission,"I'm writing to thank you for creating an Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission. I believe gerrymandering is one of the reasons we are so divided as a nation. Districts should represent a healthy diversity rather than be drawn to highlight voting patterns or narrow the demographic representation.   My hope for the Commission is that each member is able to remain objective throughout the process. Doing so will allow for the creation of districts that make sense geographically and encourage a broader range of voices, opinions, and interests on a variety of topics. I believe citizens need to be encouraged to interact with each other and examine issues that reach beyond their interests to those relevant to the greater community. Doing so will encourage compromise and move us toward change that benefits more people and avoids catering to a few with more power, wealth, or visibility.

Thank you for listening and for your efforts. With gratitude, Mary Jane Pories  P.S. I resubmitted this because I received a bounce back stating there was a problem with my submission."
1430,written,,,My thoughts on the process,"I've been giving redistricting a great deal of thought for quite some time, and here are my strong suggestions: 1) Keep counties intact if possible (ie the 7th District should not exclude Ann Arbor); 2) Keep cities intact if possible (Detroit will have to be spilt & possibly GR); 3) Keep ethnic minority neighborhoods (especially in Detroit) intact (minority groups need representation); 4) some blue and red districts are inevitable, but these should be in balance and as few as possible (ie 3 of each or fewer); 5) create as many purple districts as possible (we HAVE to minimize the gimmes).  Between the major parties, there should be as many competitive races as possible."
1431,written,,,Why I'm grateful for the Commission,"I'm writing to thank you for creating an Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission. I believe gerrymandering is one of the reasons we are so divided as a nation. Districts should represent a healthy diversity rather than be drawn to highlight voting patterns or narrow the demographic representation.   My hope for the Commission is that each member is able to remain objective throughout the process. Doing so will allow for the creation of districts that make sense geographically and encourage a broader range of voices, opinions, and interests on a variety of topics. I believe citizens need to be encouraged to interact with each other and examine issues that reach beyond their interests to those relevant to the greater community. Doing so will encourage compromise and move us toward change that benefits more people and avoids catering to a few with more power, wealth, or visibility. I believe common sense redistricting will help us elect those who are more representative of the citizenry and will more likely produce legislation that will bring about positive change.  Thank you for listening and for your efforts. With gratitude, Mary Jane Pories"
1432,written,,,Community input on Splitting Geographies,"I think the redistricting commission should not just be asking about communities of interest. They should also be asking about the other side of the coin:  If your county, city, township, etc. needs to be split, where does it make the most sense to make the split.  For instance, the current Congressional District 1 (CD1) is comprised of counties in the UP and then extends down into the upper lower peninsula. It is quite likely that a there will be a partial county in the final compilation.  Likewise, Kalamazoo and Calhoun County would like to be in the same Congressional District. If it ends up that not all of Calhoun County can be included, which part should be excluded? The mapmakers and the commissioners can make choices based on density, rural/urban mix, but residents of these split counties might have a suggestion based on something the commissioners have not considered – age of the neighborhood, types of housing (group quarters), Consumers Energy v DTE customers, etc.  Sterling Heights wants to be in a single Congressional District. If that is not possible, which part of Sterling Heights should be split from the rest of the city.  The commissioners need to be asking: If we need to split your geographic unit, where should we make the split? What criteria would you like us to use if we need to split your geographic unit? "
1433,written,,"jackson county,jackson city",COI Testimony-Senate Dists Jackson Co.,"Good evening.   I have lived in Liberty Twp. of Jackson County for almost 20 years.  I’ve voted in every election except maybe 2 or 3 minor ones, since 2001. My objective is to advocate for the interests of Jackson County when the time comes to re-draw the state senate district lines.  My current senate district, #16, includes three counties, Jackson, Hillsdale, and Branch. Jackson County does not belong in this district, for the following reasons:  * The majority of Jackson County’s population is contained in Greater Jackson, which includes the City of Jackson (population 32,000+), as well as the adjacent suburban areas of Blackman Township, Summit Township, and Leoni Township.  This area is in the northern part of the county, distinctly separated geographically from Hillsdale County to our south.  Additionally, Jackson County shares no border whatsoever with Branch County. I can personally say I’ve never had any reason to visit Branch County other than passing through on my way to Indiana. * Greater Jackson can be seen as a Community of Interest, having little in common with Hillsdale and Branch Counties.  Hillsdale and Branch are highly rural, with several small towns, and share in common that they border Ohio, and that U.S. 12 passes through both counties (but not through Jackson Co.). Greater Jackson is a mix of urban and suburban character, with the diversity and concerns accompanying a medium-sized city. * Greater Jackson, and in fact much of northern Jackson County, are marked by the vital and busy crossroads of US 127 and I-94.  Many residents of Greater Jackson, and Jackson County in general, use those major roadways for frequent, even daily, travel to Greater Lansing to the north, and especially to cities and towns to the east along I-94, including Chelsea, Dexter, and Ann Arbor. Residents of the City and County of Jackson commute in large numbers along I-94 to shop, access healthcare, attend college, and go to work, mostly in communities of western Washtenaw County.  There is no comparable commuter traffic to Hillsdale County to our south.  When the MICRC commences the important job of redrawing Michigan’s state senate district lines, my recommendation is that Greater Jackson, and Jackson County, share significant economic and cultural ties with western Washtenaw County to our east, and it would be much more fair and appropriate for those two areas to be in the same senate district.  Thank you for hearing and considering my input.  Thank you for doing this important work.  Nancy A. Smith Liberty Twp."
1434,written,,"jackson county,jackson city",COI Testimony-S.H. Districts Jackson Co.,"Good evening.  I’m here to testify about two major Communities of Interest in Jackson County. I have lived in Liberty Twp. of Jackson County for almost 20 years.  I’ve voted in every election except maybe 2 or 3 minor ones, since 2001. My area is rural in nature.  Jackson County has a lot of rural communities.  Just north of me is the city of Jackson, and its surrounding suburban area.  My observation has been that the two current state house districts in our county, 64 and 65, are unfair in that they are both drawn to favor rural communities.  And the elected reps. for 64 and 65 are both residents of rural townships, and that has been true most years going way back.  I have no argument with rural people being represented by a rural representative.  However, I do have a problem when Greater Jackson is represented by a rural representative. I'd like to start with the unfairness of the current district lines. I am attaching maps of the current lines for both HD 64 and HD 65.  Taking a look at HD 64, it includes 7 rural townships, plus the city of Jackson and the suburban township of Summit.  The current Rep. is from Hanover Township. In my view, she does not understand or connect with her urban/suburban constituents.  She is a self-described farmer.  Residents in the city of Jackson (population 32,000+) have drastically different economic and cultural interests and concerns than small town residents and farmers of rural Jackson County.  Then, taking a look at HD 65 reveals many additional problems.  First, the shape is horribly non-compact, snaking and curving from northwest Lenawee County, around eastern and northern Jackson County, and ending in Eaton County, where it includes three rural townships AND the City of Eaton Rapids.  As a resident of HD 65 myself, I can tell you that while I do identify with all of the rural parts of the district, Liberty Township shares very little in common with the suburban Blackman and Leoni Townships.  And I have almost nothing in common with a city in the next county to the north (Eaton Rapids).  District 65 is obviously unfair. Here is my recommendation for fairer representation for Jackson County (state house districts).  The rural areas and townships on the perimeter of the County (Waterloo, Henrietta, Rives, Tompkins, Springport, Parma, Sandstone, Concord, Spring Arbor, Pulaski, Hanover, Liberty, Columbia, Norvell, Napoleon, and Grass Lake) should be considered a Community of Interest due to shared characteristics of agriculture, natural resource conservation, wildlife management, lake living, country living, and concerns of internet access and healthcare access. My attached map shows this COI in blue -- this should be the Rural District of Jackson County, represented fairly and appropriately by a rural resident.   The urban area of the City of Jackson shares many interests with its adjacent suburban townships, namely Blackman, Summit and Leoni.  The City and those three townships share a major transportation crossroads of US 127 and I-94, where thousands of residents of that area travel frequently to greater Lansing to the north, and to many communities to the east, including Chelsea, Dexter, and Ann Arbor.  Residents of greater Jackson travel on those highways to shop, access healthcare, attend college, and work at their jobs.  Residents of urban/suburban greater Jackson share many cultural and economic characteristics, including shared water and sewer systems, and police and fire services.  People in this core area live in neighborhoods and apartments, and do not identify significantly with the rural/small-town/farm nature of the surrounding rural townships.  My attached map shows the Urban/Suburban District of Jackson County in yellow. It is compact in shape and includes the City of Jackson and the three adjacent suburban townships. Thank you for the opportunity to share information about Communities of Interest in Jackson County. I hope you will consider my ideas for drawing the state house district lines more fairly in Jackson County.  Thank you for doing this very important work. Nancy A. Smith, Liberty Twp.  3 Map Attachments:  HD 64, HD 65, My suggested new district lines (2 districts, one rural and the other urban/suburban)"
1435,written,,,Redrawing District 12,"Hello, I live in Pittsfield Township, between Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti.  Like many Michiganders, our congressional district makes no sense--it snakes along 94 from west Ann Arbor to Lake Erie (""downriver"") which makes zero sense.  I would like to suggest that the western part of district 12 be separated from the eastern part and combined with district 7, which itself must be redrawn to make sense.  Washtenaw county should be combined with Jackson county.  The two metro areas-- A2/Ypsi + Jackson -- are closely connected.  I know many, many people who live in or near Jackson, or western Washtenaw Co. (Dexter, Chelsea, Manchester) and work or go to school in Ann Arbor or Ypsi.   I frequently go to Chelsea or Dexter, and less frequently (but still sometimes) go to Jackson to see friends, shop, spend time in nature parks etc.   This would make much more sense from a socio-economic-cultural point of view.  But it would also have another benefit:  Neither District 12 (deep blue) nor District 7 (deep red) are competitive at all.  Voters don't really have much of a choice, not even in primaries.  Combining Washtenaw Co., which is very liberal, with Jackson Co., which is less liberal, would create a competitive district, in which candidates would have to appeal to a wide array of constituencies: upper income folks, left-wing campus people, rural, more conservative people, African Americans, Arab Americans, and white working class, etc.  It would be messy, but it would be real democracy, and it would be the vision of diverse factions and groups having to work together that our founders envisioned.   I believe this new district would be purple--and we should be aiming for all or as many as possible of our districts to be purple. "
1436,written,,,Save our rural communities,I am an elected Township Clerk of a small rural township. My biggest concern is that our township would be split up by multiple districts. The mean income of our township falls below the state mean. Our resources are limited and there are very little services available for those in need. To split the township would place undo stress on our budget. Increased election costs needed to run multiple precincts would further diminish our ability to serve our citizens.  The second concern falls in the community of interest category. We are currently in a district both house and senate that contains other rural communities. This gives us a voice by being able to elect legislators that will address our needs. Pairing rural areas with large urban areas would shut us out. Legislators elected by urban areas would not fight for the rural residents and our citizens would fall even further behind in terms of living conditions and services.

1440,written,,,I-94 Corridor Redistricting,"My name is Christi Barrett, and I reside in Marshall. I am looking to relocate to Battle Creek. I've lived in Michigan for nearly 40 years. Throughout this time, I have been perplexed about why the 3rd Congressional District includes Marshall, Battle Creek, and GRAND RAPIDS. Even looking at it on a map makes the oddness of this apparent. Battle Creek and Kalamazoo have increasingly aligned around their mutual interests, and one piece of evidence to support that is their unified United Way organization. Battle Creek has long operated in the Kalamazoo region and these communities see their interests as aligned with one another. This is not the case with Grand Rapids. I believe that the motivating factor behind looping Battle Creek with Grand Rapids is merely political, and Marshall goes along for the ride. (Traditionally, Marshall has been a Republican stronghold, but that is now fading a little bit.) I urge the commission to look at mutual interests rather than attempting to align communities to achieve a political objective - consolidating power. Thank you. "

1443,written,,,common sense,"Thank you for your efforts to improve our state's  district boundaries.  I am sure that whatever you come up with will be criticized, so good luck. Amidst all the federal and state  directives for your task combined with the political push  my greatest concern is that you will leave common sense behind. People want to simply vote and know their representatives.  So I would give great weight to keeping boundaries so that as few clerks as possible handle the vote for a given representative. People in America move around.  What is the make up of a community changes. Chasing political , ethnic, and racial groupings to set ""fair"" boundaries  can only  go so far. what boundaries  you set this year will be ""unfair"" half way to the next census.  Consider the people who administer the election,  make the ballot printing and tabulating as easy as possible."
1444,written,,,Align with county,I would like the districts to geographically align with the counties as close as possible.  The current voting districts are so confusing its hard to figure out who your representative or senator is.
1445,written,,,Gallery Difficult to Browse,"Hello - I think it's helpful to browse and comment on the other submissions and lend my voice that way, but the way it is configured is really cumbersome to navigate. If I click into a submission, it redirects me to the first page no matter what page I was previous on, and none of the links can be opened in a new tab. If the coding could be designed to open links in a new tab -- both the submissions and the pages -- that would make browsing and commenting significantly easier. Thanks for making this feature available in the first place - I think the dialogue between people's ideas and areas of expertise can be really useful, and I just want to make it easier to access!

The State supposedly linked to “volunteer parties” who could e-notarize for free, but I contacted all of them and those who replied refused to help.  I understand that governments and in particular Michigan’s government are often inefficient and full of red tape, but this seemed more deliberate in my opinion to limit participation as much as possible.  I highly recommend a review of the application process, as well as a review of how some applicants were able to get their applications notarized while many others like myself were not. I also recommend an investigation into whether the e-notaries provided by the State were selected/listed on purpose knowing they wound not help everyone and whether those e-notaries were biased towards which individuals or political parties they would assist."

1449,written,,,Issues with Current Process,"This process seems backwards. As the commission, shouldn't you be drawing up the boundaries and submitting those for public comment? Soliciting feedback without a plan or even a rough draft of the commission's process is useless. How are we supposed to comment? This plan is rife for abuse by special interests to submit numerous, detailed public comments under fake or fraudulent names to influence the commission e.g., the telecoms and fraudulent FCC comments that were overwhelming in support of the plan to end net neutrality. Only once the public actually sees what you are proposing can we then comment such as: you are breaking apart this community or these boundaries make no sense because it's not geographically contiguous or it was blatantly configured to favor one party. I honestly hope for the best with the commission, but the more we hear about the commission functioning (hiring the notorious gerrymandering firm Election Data Services whom should not have been given public money after repeatedly destroying the public's trust in fair elections across the nation) and see the lack of progress made by the commission we have to worry if we will ever see a proposal or plan actually implemented that is truly independent of gerrymandering attempts. I challenge the commission to be open and honest with the people of Michigan, reveal all conversations with Election Data Services, and to start producing proposals that are visible to the public."

Second, balanced by influence of city of closet and greatest importance, a service center. For example,  coldwater should be tied with battle creek or jalamazoo, not monroe.  Third,Current political boundaries should be maintained, and units  remaining undivided whenever possible. For example branch county should be in one district and not divided.  Fourth , whenever possible districts should be as compact as possible, creating equidistant traveling across the district in any direction. "

Bill Huizinga does not represent me or the majority of the voters in Kentwood and this infuriates me every election.

1458,written,,"washtenaw,dexter",I want to be in fair districts!,"First, I want to thank all of the commissioners for their service on this Commission. It is a very difficult task and you're getting a firehose of opinions and that must make it even more difficult.  I live in Dexter, Michigan. Before 2011, my state senate district was represented by the senator named by MIRS news service as ""most liberal"". After 2011, my state senator was the one named by MIRS as ""most conservative"". The 22nd state senate district as it is drawn now has me represented by someone (a) who wins by huge conservative margins and (b) whose views are radically different from mine. These two factors make it so my senator doesn't have to take my views into account. And she doesn't.   It's much the same for my member of Congress. The 7th Congressional District runs from the west side of Lansing, all the way to Lake Erie. It skirts around the cities of Lansing, Ann Arbor, and Detroit to maintain a solid conservative voting population. So, here again, my member of Congress has no incentive to listen to my views. And he doesn't.  My community of interest as a resident of a small but growing city just outside of a major city (Ann Arbor) along the I-94 corridor. Dexter is much more like other cities along I-94 such as Chelsea to the west. I have family and friends who live in my hometown of Jackson and I travel this area extensively. These communities have similar challenges with broadband and other infrastructure. They are also becoming more racially diverse as people who work in the cities around them move outside of the city.  My senate district now has me grouped with the small villages and conservative enclaves to the north like Pinckney and Brighton where I have little connection. A more fair district for my area would include more geography to the west of me toward Jackson.  I'm not asking to be districts that are guaranteed to be won by a Democrat. I want to be in districts where my senator and representative feel they need to listen to my views and won't ignore them because they'll win anyway.  Thank you for your time."

1460,written,,,MI House Districts for the U.P.,"I drew this map, https://districtr.org/plan/14746, using DistrictR. In this map, I put all of Marquette County in the 109th MI House district, and I moved Schoolcraft County from the 109th and into into the 108th MI House district (with Escanaba). There are three advantages: 1) Marquette County is no longer split, restoring the links between Big Bay and Marquette (and keeping Powell Township and Ishpeming Township with the rest of the county); 2) It makes the 109th MI House district a Lake Superior-oriented county, the 108th MI House district a Lake Michigan-oriented county, and the 110th MI House district a West End-oriented county; and 3) It makes the 109th MI House district a little less Republican leaning (because Schoolcraft County is heavily Republican, as is the rest of the 108th MI House district) — this would mean that only one MI House district in the UP would be close to even (Dem/Rep), while the rest of the U.P. MI House districts would remain more strongly Republican leaning. Having one district in the U.P. a little closer to even is more fair than having them all Republican leaning (I realize that a Democrat currently occupies the 109th MI House district).  One disadvantage with this map is acceptable: it increases the population skew between MI House districts from a little over 5% to 7.99%, but this is within the normal guideline to keep state legislative districts within 10% (only Congressional districts have to be closer to 1% or less). Of course, this is only based on population estimates before the current Census, and it uses the 2016 Presidential election as the predictor for voting tendencies. Nevertheless, the new maps should keep the U.P counties together and orient them to the lakes as much as practical. If counties are split, they should orient to the lakes even more strongly (creating longer, narrower lake districts that are different from interior districts).  I did not attempt to alter any kind of districts in the Lower Peninsula because I am less familiar with issues downstate. Nevertheless, I think that L.P. districts should also attempt to recognize orientation to each Great Lake, as distinct from interior areas. Obviously, L.P. districts also need to follow the new MI Constitutional requirements, and I do not favor starting with the current districts in the L.P., especially the highly populated areas where gerrymandering is an obvious problem."

1464,written,,,Change Needed,"Rather than jury rig district boundaries based on political point of view, the state should be divided into 14 equally populated rectangles. The District map should start on the southern border and carve out essentially rectangular districts. Each district would essentially have 4 sides and encompass all residents in urban, suburban and rural areas within that rectangle.  The benefits would be that each district would be easily identifiable,  reps would represent citizens of all beliefs and persuasions, and the ultra political current system would be replaced with an equitable plan for all MI citizens."

Our Senator can focus on issues specific to Kalamazoo County and more easily stay current with what is going on with the county commission and local municipalities. As long as the population of Kalamazoo County approximates the population of a Senate district, please consider keeping the boundaries of the 20th Senate District as close as possible to those of Kalamazoo County."

1468,written,,,State Districting,"I have been a registered voter since 1976 and have witnessed some of the most distressing conduct by elected officials and candidates for office.  My suggestion may alleviate some, if not, all of the problems with districting.  All elected officials should run ""At Large"".  Candidates wouldn't have to hide where they reside.  If they are strong candidates then they would conduct themselves in such a way as to appeal to anyone in the State.  The 2 Party system wouldn't be able to redraw district lines to benefit their respective party.  Population would not be a factor in elections.  Candidates from the U.P.  may have answers for Detroit that haven't been addressed.  Elected officials may even be able to work more constructively with each other.  This may even be more cost effective.  With regards. "

Whenever a citizen wants to contact anyone in the state legislature, state committees, executive office, programs, etc. we are asked to give our name, address and contact information (phone or email).  This should be for your committee, too.  Sincerely, Janet Salisbury 233 Grace Ave Rochester Hills, MI 48307 248-260-7444 "
1470,written,,,The party with the most votes should win,"The Michigan government borders on illegitimate because the party with the most votes is not always the party that wins. This is because districts were created with the goal of benefiting a particular political party. This, however, is not the goal of democracies. The goal of democracies is to best represent the people. If the party with the most votes does not win, then by extension the system does not fulfill a central goal of democracies and is an illegitimate government. This is true whether Republicans or Democrats are overrepresented in the government and so it is of bi-partisan importance to draw districting lines that make it so that the party with the most votes wins. Failure to do so will create a system that is not democratic and is illegitimate. "

However, we have two voting districts for the MI House of Representatives within our new boundaries. Such a circumstance should be one way of defining a ""community of interest"". Contiguous to the Marshall School District in Eastern Calhoun County is the Homer Schools to the south, the Mar Lee Schools to the north, and the Tekonsha Schools to the southwest. My recommendation is to capture the eastern Calhoun County region from the eastern boundaries of Harper Creek Schools and Athens Schools east to the Jackson County line.

It's not obvious that protections are in place to clearly identify which submissions source from citizens of Michigan versus people of other states or even activist organizations intent on disrupting the process for partisan gain. I am deeply disturbed by this omission, and recommend that the form be revised ASAP to mandate full names, organizational affiliations, and mailing addresses.   If the Commission does not differentiate the feedback of Michigan residents from out-of-state activists and consultants, I cannot accept the work of the Commission as being legitimate. This oversight in data collection will lead to a severe breach in trust about the Commission's fairness and its transparency. Particularly in a divided political era, it's essential that this Commission set a standard for fairness. So far, I'm not seeing signs of it."

Anyone, from anywhere would be able to provide their own suggestions to push the district lines how it may benefit them.  I already feel this Independent Redistricting Commission is a scam and I am definitely not the only person who feels like this. I have never, never, never seen a person claiming to be an Independent, caucus with anyone, except for Democrats. I really hope I'm wrong and I will gladly apologize if I am.

1487,written,,"competitiveness,compactness,gerrymandering,draw competitive seats",Compactness vs. Competitiveness,"In 2010, redistricting became a tool that was weaponized against Michigan's voters. The districts that were drawn cut up communities of interest in the name of partisan gerrymandering. And while the maps drawn in 2010 may have eventually become much more competitive than their creators intended, they never should have been drawn without competitiveness in mind in the first place. While it is tempting to judge a district based on how compact it is, and while it is extremely important to keep cities and communities of interest together, competitiveness should not be sacrificed for the sake of compactness. The polarization that plagues American and Michigan politics today stems in large part from political extremism, and you'll find that this extremism almost always comes from members of Congress or the state legislature who come from ""safe"" districts (maps that are overwhelmingly Democratic or Republican). One way to solve this problem is to create more competitive seats, where representatives must work for everyone in their district if they want to be re-elected, not just the voters who support their party. While some seats will always have to be drawn as ""safe"" (see Detroit for Democrats or the thumb for Republicans), mapmakers should prioritize drawing competitive seats where they can exist, such as in the Detroit suburbs or the Lansing area). Doing this is an important step in holding elected representatives accountable and mending the partisan split in our politics, and it is a step that this commission can take when it redraws Michigan's districts."

It is ethnically diverse; it is home to the largest population of Jews in Michigan. It has a major Chaldean Christian community, a large Black community, Arab community, Indian community, and the largest Japanese community in the state.  Greater West Bloomfield includes the neighboring cities of Orchard Lake, Sylvan Lake, and Keego Harbor. The four towns share emergency services and the Greater West Bloomfield Chamber of Commerce, Greater West Bloomfield Historical Society, Greater West Bloomfield Community Coalition, Greater West Bloomfield Cable Commission, and more. They also share policy interests, overlapping with the West Bloomfield School District and housing the headwaters of the Huron, Clinton, and Rouge river watersheds.  Greater West Bloomfield is a clearly-defined community of interest that the Commission must keep together in state legislative and congressional maps.  The 2011 maps sliced through Greater West Bloomfield to such a degree that even the most attuned voters struggle to remember who represents them or what district they live in. As you can see, our community is divided into 5 areas, with little overlap in state and federal representation. West Bloomfield also bears the unfortunate distinction as one of the only larger towns in the state to be so divided - into 2 house districts, 2 senate districts, and 2 congressional districts.  The current map disempowers our community and stifles collective political action in Greater West Bloomfield. You have the power - and duty - to change that.  As you can see, the 2011 gerrymander was blatant. They tore up the competitive 39th House District (which a Democrat won by just 87 votes in 2010) and created two Republican leaning districts by cracking West Bloomfield in half, and replacing Democratic precincts (where the incumbent happened to live) with Republican ones. The current gerrymander was motivated by partisanship, but undoing it is not.  The Commission must not divide West Bloomfield Township. It must keep all of West Bloomfield, Orchard Lake, Sylvan Lake, and Keego Harbor together for the State House, State Senate, and Congress.  Drawing maps even remotely similar to the current ones, adding a few precincts here and there, would perpetuate this punitive, partisan gerrymander - which is exactly what this Commission was established to prevent.  Thank you. I deeply appreciate your time and your efforts on behalf of our state.  https://davesredistricting.org/join/547a28a7-0c58-41d4-a9a8-8347122163b1"

Using the counties I feel is the most straightforward and unbiased method because they were established long ago and cannot be challenged as partisan boundary making.  I used the biggest population counties as starting points and when they became less then a full seat I added surrounding counties until a full district-approx 700,000 people was equaled.  Sub districts can use townships in the same way as established boundaries to group.  Small slicing may need to be done, but as long as it's along the edges of the established boundaries they should not be challenged for partisanship.  I look forward to what the commission ends up with, but I recommend by using straightforward and established county boundaries as much as possible you will give the voters what they wanted-fair unbiased districts.

Please restore our respective Midland and Bay County townships -- this is where we live, shop, and send our kids to school.  Dividing us up into different districts dilutes our voice and let's our representatives ignore our interests. Perhaps, If our 10 Midland Townships: Mills, Hope, Edenville, Warren, Geneva, Greendale, Jasper, Porter, Mt. Haley, and Ingersoll had been included in our district they would have had stronger voices to demand our Dam issues over the years! We look forward to fairer districts that make geographic common sense.  Please keep Midland County intact.  And please draw geographically compact senate and congressional district maps. "

Also enjoyed by canoers and kayakers, the International Au Sable River Canoe Marathon and seasonal and year round residents.  Originating near Frederic, 10 miles north of Grayling, the Au Sable terminates in Oscoda at the Lake Huron shore. Currently, the Grayling and Oscoda communities are struggling with PFAs contamination from military activity.  So you can see we have a number of reasons to consider the Au Sable River Valley a Community of Interest."

1742,coi,,"rural,urban,washtenawandwayne,bordercounties,universities",Improving Regions,"I have mapped two communities of interest. One is Washtenaw and Wayne county, the other is the border counties and Jackson county. These two communities have little in common, and should not in any way be combined in representation. For example, the commission decided to lump Washtenaw County and Monroe county together in a regional plan. While these regions are starting points and were determined previously by bureaucrats in DC, as a lifelong Michigander who is familiar with the areas and unique definition of these communities, here are some thoughts to clean these regions up for district drawings. Washtenaw County is much more connected to Wayne county. For example, the University of Michigan has a campus in Ann Arbor (Washtenaw) and Dearborn extension (Wayne). Additionally, with Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti, the Ann Arbor-Ypsi connection should not be separated - especially in federal representation since the universities in this area deserve a representative focused on higher education and urban challenges. Washtenaw County and Wayne county have technology startups and large company offices. This urban area should not have to be represented by someone who is also representing large swaths of urban Michigan. Please consider these differences, and do not combine these two distinctively separate communities in a congressional seat. The rural community I mapped is much more agriculturally based.

1743,coi,,"rural,urban,washtenawandwayne,bordercounties,universities",Improving Regions,"I have mapped two communities of interest. One is Washtenaw and Wayne county, the other is the border counties and Jackson county. These two communities have little in common, and should not in any way be combined in representation. For example, the commission decided to lump Washtenaw County and Monroe county together in a regional plan. While these regions are starting points and were determined previously by bureaucrats in DC, as a lifelong Michigander who is familiar with the areas and unique definition of these communities, here are some thoughts to clean these regions up for district drawings. Washtenaw County is much more connected to Wayne county. For example, the University of Michigan has a campus in Ann Arbor (Washtenaw) and Dearborn extension (Wayne). Additionally, with Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti, the Ann Arbor-Ypsi connection should not be separated - especially in federal representation since the universities in this area deserve a representative focused on higher education and urban challenges. Washtenaw County and Wayne county have technology startups and large company offices. This urban area should not have to be represented by someone who is also representing large swaths of urban Michigan. Please consider these differences, and do not combine these two distinctively separate communities in a congressional seat. The rural community I mapped is much more agriculturally based.
