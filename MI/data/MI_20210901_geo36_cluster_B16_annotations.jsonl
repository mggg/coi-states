Macatawa itself is not a town, but it does have a post office, a large marina and yacht club. The reason I am writing this testimony is because for decades, the Macatawa community (peninsula) has been split in half horizontally along an imaginary line that is an extension of 32nd Street in Holland, running east to west. Everything to the north of 32nd Street is in Ottawa County and Park Township. Everything to the south is in Allegan County and Laketown Township. What does this have to do with redistricting?

So everyone in the north part of Macatawa is in the 2nd Congressional District, the 30th State Senate and 98th State House District. Everyone to the south is in the 6th Congressional District, the 26th State Senate and 80th State House District. We should be represented by ONE person in each legislative body, not two. Some of the issues we are facing are high water on both lakes and severe beach erosion. We had to spend a lot of money on revetment in 2020 and our beach access is still compromised. It makes it more difficult for our community to address this if we have to consult two Congressmen, two State Senators and two State Representatives. I believe Macatawa should be represented together as one,  joined with the beach communities to the south on Lake Michigan and to the east on Lake Macatawa.
